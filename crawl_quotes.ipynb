Molding something, whether it be a roster on a label, or your blog, or a song, or your DJ set.\",\n \"I like getting feedback from people who show a lot of potential, and it's exciting to witness to new talents developing and bourgeoning. I always try to stay around the newest stuff, I don't like to stay with something that's kind of old or approaching it.\",\n \"Right now it feels like we're playing a role, like me and a couple of my friends, in where popular culture is going. That's a very rare thing in a person's life to be able to be a part of that. It's a responsibility I take seriously.\",\n \"I've talked to people who say that their music and their creative work is a much needed and appreciated escape, where they don't have to think about the state of the world; they're not even thinking about themselves so much. They're not trying to express their own experiences of that day or relationship strife or anything.\",\n \"At the end of the day, if I do a set at a festival and I only have an hour, which is kind of short for a DJ set, I know that I have to play at least six of my songs. Then the whole challenge is what do I weave around that. How do I stand out? Because at a festival there's probably fifteen songs every DJ's going to play every hour, for the whole day. That to me is more interesting, because I still feel like an outsider in this world.\",\n \"When you know what you like and what you want and you're able to nudge things in the right direction, that's more profitable than ever, because there's so much information out there. Everything's saturated. Tastemaker is probably the most overused word, but I still think it's important.\",\n \"There's a bit less elbow room and latitude to take it somewhere else, at least at festivals. In the club you can do whatever you want but at festivals, especially Ultra, nowadays the crowd wants to hear our songs.\",\n 'When I get up I still check the rap blogs before I check any kind of dance stuff.',\n \"We have to wake up early and make songs everyday. I run my record label. You work at hours where your body isn't designed to work. But it's fun.\",\n 'There are things I like, there are things I strongly dislike. In my DJ sets and in my production I just gravitate towards what I like.',\n \"I have a radio show on Sirius XM. I put it up as a free download on my Soundcloud and on iTunes. That's a portal for me once a month, to play songs I know aren't getting played on that station the rest of the week.\",\n \"Traditionally, with a DJ set, you just go hear DJ that has a good reputation and let the DJ take you somewhere. It was up to the DJ what he wanted to play. Typically in dance music, people didn't know most of the songs a DJ played.\"]"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n# Tạo DataFrame từ danh sách này\nmerged_df = pd.DataFrame({'Quote': data})\n\n\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-06T08:30:38.778723Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-06T08:30:38.779533Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-06T08:30:38.792888Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-06T08:30:38.779490Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-06T08:30:38.792012Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":57,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"merged_df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-06T08:30:40.245929Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-06T08:30:40.246757Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-06T08:30:40.259926Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-06T08:30:40.246723Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-06T08:30:40.259018Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":58,"outputs":[{"execution_count":58,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"                                                   Quote\n0      [The best advice I've got was - \"All you have ...\n1      [It's a good feeling to have something to stan...\n2      [Traveling is one expression of the desire to ...\n3      [If you can control yourself sexually, you can...\n4      [On rare occasions there comes along a profoun...\n...                                                  ...\n28379  [Always be who YOU are, be self-aware, and lov...\n28380                                                 []\n28381                                                 []\n28382  [I think when we engage in language we are eng...\n28383  [You don't need the frills and thrills to make...\n\n[28384 rows x 1 columns]","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Quote</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>[The best advice I've got was - \"All you have ...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>[It's a good feeling to have something to stan...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>[Traveling is one expression of the desire to ...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>[If you can control yourself sexually, you can...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>[On rare occasions there comes along a profoun...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>28379</th>\n      <td>[Always be who YOU are, be self-aware, and lov...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>28380</th>\n      <td>[]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>28381</th>\n      <td>[]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>28382</th>\n      <td>[I think when we engage in language we are eng...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>28383</th>\n      <td>[You don't need the frills and thrills to make...</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>28384 rows × 1 columns</p>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"new_df = new_df.reset_index()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-06T08:26:03.725505Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-06T08:26:03.725870Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-06T08:26:03.744660Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-06T08:26:03.725843Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-06T08:26:03.743660Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":48,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"new_df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-06T08:26:07.609220Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-06T08:26:07.609566Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-06T08:26:07.625436Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-06T08:26:07.609540Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-06T08:26:07.624344Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":49,"outputs":[{"execution_count":49,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"       index         Column1                   Column2               Column3  \\\n0          2   A Fine Frenzy         Singer-songwriter  b.

And why should we put any faith in a book that includes such brutality?\n12\n0\n13\n0\n14\nI don't like it when people don't look me dead in the eye.

I finally understand the anger behind feminism - the idea that as a woman you are property to be conveyed between your father and your husband, but never an individual who exists independently. And on the flip side, it is also one of the few ways one can legitimately get lost - no one questions it.\n30\n0\n31\n0\n32\nA film just doesn't involve actors, a director and a producer, there is also the cameraman, the sound engineer, the music composer, the lyric writer. So many people come together to make a film. When we all feel satisfied with the film that we have created it's a win for all of us.\n33\n0\n34\n0\n35\n0\n36\n0\n37\n0\n38\n0\n39\nI've always found it pretty difficult to write a happy song. Since I was a kid, when I pick up my guitar it's been hard for me to write some sort of bubblegum lyrics. It's not really ever been my route.\n40\n0\n41\n0\n42\n0\n43\n0\n44\n0\n45\n0\n46\n0\n47\nSome movies get rushed out right after you make them and I'm not always happy with that.\n48\n0\n49\n0\n50\n0\n51\n0\n52\n0\n53\n0\n54\n0\n55\n0\n56\n0\n57\n0\n58\n0\n59\n0\n60\n0\n61\n0\n62\n0\n63\nAnyone with a gun can go out and commit an act of terrorism, even without a political affiliation.\n64\n0\n65\nI have 14 nieces and nephews.\n66\n0\n67\nI think as you get older, you realize there's always going to be critics. Critics are going to win every time because they can change their critique based on the stats and their own personal feelings.\n68\n0\n69\n0\n70\n0\n71\n0\n72\n0\n73\nEducation is the silver bullet. Education is everything. We don't need little changes, we need gigantic, monumental changes. Schools should be palaces. The competition for the best teachers should be fierce. They should be making six-figure salaries. Schools should be incredibly expensive for government and absolutely free of charge to its citizens, just like national defense. That's my position. I just haven't figured out how to do it yet.\n74\n0\n75\n0\n76\n0\n77\nSomething like making the NIT would have been a great way to showcase the season we had.\n78\n0\n79\nSinging for stage, if you don't hear yourself, that's when you push, and that's when you can hurt your voice sometimes. So if I can hear myself in my ear, it really helps me to find that balance of how loud I needed to be singing.\n80\n0\n81\n0\n82\n0\n83\n0\n84\nThe experience of being on a show that is very much in the center of popular culture is exciting. You really feel like you're reaching people.\n85\n0\n86\nI feel like battle rap is as popular as it's ever been, today. With Total Slaughter it's getting real popular.\n87\n0\n88\n0\n89\n0\n90\n0\n91\nIn real life, I'm pretty much an eternal optimist.\n92\n0\n93\n0\n94\n0\n95\n0\n96\n0\n97\n0\n98\n0\n99\n0\n100\n0\n101\n0\n102\n0\n103\n0\n104\n0\n105\n0\n106\n0\n107\n0\n108\n0\n109\n0\n110\n0\n111\n0\n112\nI'm a lapsed Buddhist like I'm a lapsed Catholic.

I enjoy it so much. All that matters is getting the songs played well, trying to get them to sound as close to the record live, which isn't easy, because my music is quite complicated to play.\n146\n0\n147\nI'm not much of a jokester.\n148\n0\n149\n0\n150\n0\n151\n0\n152\nComic books aren't nerdy. You'd have to be an idiot to think computers are nerdy.\n153\n0\n154\n0\n155\n0\n156\nLife is just the time between crapping yourself.\n157\n0\n158\n0\n159\nI don't necessarily notice too much of a change in the sense of the kind of matches that I have in say a Los Angeles as opposed to a New York City. The big difference that I notice, and this is what all love as New York city and Philadelphia has treated me fantastically, but man, you cannot screw up in Philadelphia and New York.\n160\n0\n161\n0\n162\n0\n163\n0\n164\nI'm conflicted with theater in the city because you want to reach a diverse audience, and that audience doesn't typically go to the theater.\n165\n0\n166\nWhen everybody loves me, I will never be lonely.\n167\n0\n168\n0\n169\n0\n170\n0\n171\n0\n172\n0\n173\n0\n174\n0\n175\nLeafing through Forbes or Fortune [magazine]s is like reading the operating manual of a strangely sanctimonious pirate ship\n176\n0\n177\n0\n178\n0\n179\n0\n180\n0\n181\n0\n182\n0\n183\n0\n184\n0\n185\n0\n186\n0\n187\n0\n188\n0\n189\n0\n190\n0\n191\n0\n192\n0\n193\nThere's a certain amount of mind control that happens. Everybody is living in a world where they're being controlled. They're being told what to think, what to do, and what to eat.\n194\n0\n195\n0\n196\n0\n197\nThere's nothing to win in yoga. You just do what you can do, one day to the next.\n198\nDave Herman as Michael Bolton is one of my favorite performances ever.\n199\n0\n200\n0\n201\n0\n202\n0\n203\n0\n204\n0\n205\n0\n206\n0\n207\n0\n208\nThere must be some unwritten law that says about fifty people have to move into your house when somebody dies. If it weren't for the smell of death clinging to the walls, you might think it was your family's turn to host the month neighborhood potluck supper.\n209\n0\n210\n0\n211\n0\n212\n0\n213\nI lived in San Jose for a little bit, and one of my neighbors was Vietnamese and was teasing me. I said \"I've had pho,\" and then he goes, \"Oh, what do you get, the number one big bowl?\" I was like, \"Come on, man. You don't have to come at me like that.\" But yeah, I've tried tendon. Tendon eventually yields.\n214\n0\n215\n0\n216\n0\n217\n0\n218\n0\n219\n0\n220\nSo let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink, put you to bed when youve had too much to drink.\nOh, it could be so nice to grow old with you, I wanna grow old with you.\n221\nsticks and stones can only break bones; but words can shatter the soul\n222\nA tremendous number of people come to the country legally, but overstay their visas. And there has to be a far stronger mechanism for being able to track down people, have overstayed their visas, to have a responsibility for who they're coming to visit or stay with.\n223\n0\n224\n0\n225\n0\n226\n0\n227\n0\n228\n0\n229\n0\n230\n0\n231\n0\n232\nWhen I was a small boy, old people used to squat down to my eye level and ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up, to which my answer was invariably, \"a pirate.\" Their stunned silence was always very reassuring.\n233\n0\n234\n0\n235\n0\n236\n0\n237\n0\n238\n0\n239\nWe have always said there are two ways to resolve Syria, and both will end up with the same result: a Syria without Bashar Assad.\n240\n0\n241\n0\n242\n0\n243\n0\n244\nSometimes it lasts in love,\n But sometimes it hurts instead.\n245\n0\n246\n0\n247\n0\n248\n0\n249\n0\n250\n0\n251\nI'm known for playing bad guys, so this was an interesting departure from what I'm known to play, which is a softer, more likable, affable character.\n252\n0\n253\n0\n254\n0\n255\n0\n256\n0\n257\n0\n258\n0\n259\n0\n260\n0\n261\n0\n262\n0\n263\n0\n264\n0\n265\n0\n266\n0\n267\n0\n268\n0\n269\nYou ask any actor - they'll tell you they'd rather shoot on location because you don't have to invent the energy, the energy is there.\n270\n0\n271\n0\n272\n0\n273\n0\n274\n0\n275\n0\n276\n0\n277\n0\n278\nI understand that my son loves me and I love him, and everything just really got blown out of proportion, and I'm OK with that. I'm still here. My son is around me all the time. At the end of the day he still loves me and I love him, so it is what it is.\n279\n0\n280\n0\n281\nI get nervous about the effect that the high speed of everything will have on creativity. It's already sad for me to see that a lot of young aspiring cartoonists are putting stuff on the web, doing animation on the computer rather than making zines or mini-comics, which seem to be going the way of the dinosaur.\n282\n0\n283\n0\n284\nI try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, but I have to indulge every now and then!\n285\n0\n286\n0\n287\n0\n288\n0\n289\nMy parents have raised me with a sense of what's really important and have given me decent values, and I'm comfortable, but I haven't lived an excessive lifestyle in the least.

Cause and effect still exist even where there is no time.\n296\n0\n297\n0\n298\nI knew that as a DJ from 1970 on up that I would eventually come with this sound.

Their films were OK, but I was different. It's like when you start to jump and you put the pole very high - you have to jump very high.

I went on to be inspired by many other artists and forms of art, and was soon directed to a place that would help harness my experiences and develop my voice within the craft, LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts in New York City.\n348\nPop culture hales you and wants you to fail.\n349\nIn terms of finding that first international recognition of my work, coming back to Cannes is such a milestone in my life because it began actually with 'Devdas'.\n350\n0\n351\n0\n352\n0\n353\n0\n354\n0\n355\n0\n356\n0\n357\n0\n358\n0\n359\nI did join the Revolutionary Guard, but I was simply a simple Revolutionary Guard, never a commander.\n360\n0\n361\n0\n362\n0\n363\n0\n364\n0\n365\n0\n366\n0\n367\n0\n368\n0\n369\n0\n370\n0\n371\n0\n372\n0\n373\n0\n374\n0\n375\n0\n376\nI like comedy when its mixed with action, it's just so much fun to do comedy with a bit of action, its fun to watch and also so much fun to do.\n377\n0\n378\n0\n379\n0\n380\n0\n381\n0\n382\n0\n383\n0\n384\n0\n385\nBut in the right-wing media, they do have a right-wing bias. And they also have an agenda. So their agenda is: we're an adjunct of the Republican Party, and we're going push that agenda every day, and, as you say, brand these stories that help further the right-wing cause.\n386\n0\n387\n0\n388\nA low voter turnout is an indication of fewer people going to the polls.\n389\n0\n390\n0\n391\n0\n392\nRock n Roll Animal, the live album, is one of the greatest live albums out there.

I think we in the church have treated it differently than we've treated anything else. We've made it bigger; the resolution for this needs to be bigger than for other people. I think we have to do a better job than we've done. So I do think there is, people rush to judgment and rush to clarify their point on this issue in ways that they don't' rush to judgment and to clarity on other issues.\n450\n0\n451\n0\n452\n0\n453\nWhen you learn to say yes to yourself, you will be able to say no to others, with love.\n454\nIt has been said that the great scientific disciplines are examples of giants standing on the shoulders of other giants.

We don't actually deal with reality directly. We simply compose a picture of reality from what's going on in our retinas, in the timpani of our ears, and in our nerve endings.\n494\n0\n495\n0\n496\n0\n497\n0\n498\n0\n499\n0\n500\n0\n501\n0\n502\n0\n503\n0\n504\n0\n505\n0\n506\n0\n507\n0\n508\n0\n509\n0\n510\n0\n511\n0\n512\nI don't believe in God and all that. But I am Jewish, and very proud to be so, very proud of the culture.\n513\nI was very inventive. I lived in my own world - my dad said I was a loner. Not lonely, just happy in my own company. It's the same now. I need time alone, which is maybe why I love to write. Having said that, I love the sociability of telly. It's a nice contrast.\n514\n0\n515\nI haven't been to too many cons since Star Wars, and I don't think it's really going to change until it comes out.\n516\n0\n517\n0\n518\n0\n519\n0\n520\n0\n521\n0\n522\n0\n523\n0\n524\n0\n525\n0\n526\nI don't believe in bad.

That, of course, didn't work at all. Your taste in rock 'n' roll does not say anything about you, morally or otherwise.\n591\n0\n592\n0\n593\n0\n594\n0\n595\n0\n596\n0\n597\n0\n598\n0\n599\n0\n600\n0\n601\nPeople are always going to identify with what it's like living in society and have people judge you in certain ways, and how you can be strong enough to be your own person and all those good things.\n602\n0\n603\n0\n604\nWe discovered this halfway through the process. When we started making the film there were some lines of dialogue in Portuguese, but we then changed our minds. The film started from very specific issues in the world, in particular Latin America, but halfway through the journey we felt the necessity to have more universal ideas that were not so specific.\n605\n0\n606\n0\n607\n0\n608\n0\n609\n0\n610\n0\n611\n0\n612\n0\n613\n0\n614\n0\n615\n0\n616\n0\n617\n0\n618\n0\n619\n0\n620\nI don't want an angry song with no silver lining ending up on my album. Then I'd have to play, or feel obliged to play, that song every night in repetition as a mantra of anger.\n621\nSometimes you look in a field and you see a cow and you think it's a better cow than the one you've got in your own field. It's a fact. Right? And it never really works out that way.\n622\n0\n623\nNever underestimate a girl’s love for her favorite band. Never think even for a minute, that she won’t defend them to her death.\n624\nThe stuff about film being a collaborative medium is no joke.\n625\n0\n626\n0\n627\n0\n628\nAn angel once told me, \"The inevitable consequence of love is the building of Temples.\"\n629\n0\n630\nI believe that one of the reasons Gravity Falls is such an unusual place, maybe part of the reason that the stoplights switch on and off at random times and cell phones don't get proper reception and compasses spin wildly - is because of the strange kinetic influence of the UFO buried just underneath everyone's feet.\n631\n0\n632\n0\n633\n0\n634\n0\n635\nI'm not saying that people shouldn't go out to football games and drink beer and have a good time, I do it myself. But, at the same time, people are so apathetic and that shows me that they don't care about themselves. They have no self-image. Their image is projected to them via the television and that is where they make decisions about who they are according to what the public says they ought to be.\n636\nThe Beatles were huge for me, ... I used to jump around the room to the red album, the one with all the early hits on it. It made you feel euphoric. It was a sensation I couldn't get from anything else, whether it was playing football, swimming or even seeing 'Star Wars.'\n637\n0\n638\n0\n639\n0\n640\n0\n641\n0\n642\n0\n643\n0\n644\n0\n645\n0\n646\n0\n647\n0\n648\n0\n649\n0\n650\n0\n651\n0\n652\nI did a modeling gig once, but I am not a model.

I see old ladies on the street who have fabulous style and realize it's because they are probably wearing really classic items that they've had for years and years. I think if you find something that suits you, you should just stick to it.\n672\n0\n673\n0\n674\n0\n675\n0\n676\n0\n677\n0\n678\n0\n679\nTrust me-that toilet and me were best friends for the first few days I was here.\n680\n0\n681\n0\n682\n0\n683\n0\n684\n0\n685\n0\n686\n0\n687\n0\n688\n0\n689\n0\n690\n0\n691\n0\n692\nAny author of fiction will tell you that characters don't need to be told what to do.\n693\n0\n694\n0\n695\n0\n696\n0\n697\n0\n698\nOlympics are probably the most important thing for Russians than any other athletes in the whole world. Since I was a little kid and since everybody was a little kid, their dream was playing in Olympic Games, especially if we have a chance to represent our country in Sochi, it's unbelievable and it's going to be a great thing.\n699\nA book suggests a whole world and story that I could have never thought of in a million years.\n700\n0\n701\n0\n702\n0\n703\n0\n704\nWhen we were shooting in Shreveport, me and a couple of friends went down to Lafayette, because they had a big Zydeco music festival down there. We spent two days dancing to Zydeco music, eating fried alligator... It was one of the craziest festivals I've ever been to in my life, but I loved it.\n705\n0\n706\n0\n707\nArtists are never complete people. But if it's art that completes them, then what is taken away?\n708\n0\n709\nIf you're designing out of a purely creative place, not thinking of the girl, then the consumer's not going to take notice.\n710\n0\n711\n0\n712\n0\n713\n0\n714\n0\n715\n0\n716\n0\n717\n0\n718\nCharlize Theron is perfect. She holds herself with so much poise and grace.

They don't have to start companies, but that's what makes them great employees, that's what makes them great citizens.\n752\n0\n753\n0\n754\nI think that the best guarantee for the Cypriot people to feel safe is the potential of a fair and sustainable solution.\n755\n0\n756\n0\n757\n0\n758\nHistorically, there is a fight between the sound designer and the composer. You see them in the mixing room and they're always fighting because the composer wants the music to be heard and the sound designer wants the sound to be heard.\n759\nOn some kind of unspoken, deep, deep level, I think we [with Ryan Murphy] have an aesthetic that we both understand or connect to. It's not that we see the world in the same way because we have very different points of view, but we're both visual stylists.\n760\n0\n761\n0\n762\n0\n763\n0\n764\n0\n765\n0\n766\n0\n767\n0\n768\n0\n769\n0\n770\n0\n771\nIf anything, as a general rule, the cheaper the movie the more creative the experience, generally speaking. Its not to denigrate expensive movies. I dont want to seem biting the hands that feed me, but with big movies, especially with a lot of effects, the role of the actor is somewhat diminished.\n772\n0\n773\n0\n774\n0\n775\n0\n776\n0\n777\n0\n778\n0\n779\n0\n780\n0\n781\n0\n782\n0\n783\n0\n784\n0\n785\n0\n786\n0\n787\n0\n788\n0\n789\n0\n790\nThere's a directness and a feistiness to being from Jersey.\n791\n0\n792\n0\n793\n0\n794\n0\n795\n0\n796\n0\n797\n0\n798\n0\n799\n0\n800\nI'm more verbal and not as private as I was as a kid.\n801\n0\n802\n0\n803\nI always tell people, 'Everything you’ve heard about Alice Cooper , you can believe maybe 40 percent of it. Everything you’ve ever heard about Keith Moon is true - and you’ve only heard 10 percent of it.'\n804\n0\n805\n0\n806\nMy dad's always been a famous actor, so I've grown up with that, and with the lifestyle. In a way, I think I thrive on the insecurity that comes with it. Not in my private life - I like to believe that my friendships and my relationships are strong.\n807\n0\n808\n0\n809\n0\n810\nI'm at the point where going forward is easier than going back.\n811\n0\n812\n0\n813\n0\n814\n0\n815\n0\n816\n0\n817\n0\n818\n0\n819\nI watched my beautiful sister running . . . and I knew she was not running away from me or toward me.

And not confidence in a way that's only on the surface, but a deep-down knowing of yourself or settling into who you are.\n829\n0\n830\n0\n831\nI love chocolate. I like milk and dark chocolate, but definitely not white.\n832\nI think people want love in their lives.\n833\n0\n834\n0\n835\n0\n836\n0\n837\n0\n838\n0\n839\n0\n840\n0\n841\n0\n842\n0\n843\nI get to do for a living what I did as a child for fun, and that's pretty cool.\n844\nMy parents are definitely reformed hippies.\n845\n0\n846\n0\n847\n0\n848\nOn the Web we all become small-town visitors lost in the big city.\n849\n0\n850\n0\n851\n0\n852\n0\n853\n0\n854\n0\n855\n0\n856\n0\n857\nWhat is the matter with these people, these people who won't stop fighting, won't stop hurting each other...?\n858\n0\n859\n0\n860\nI find that a lot of my best character stuff and ideas come unwittingly from novels. In scripts, it's a lot about the outward signs of whatever's happening - you have the end result. Whereas in a novel you get a buildup of the whys and wherefores, and you're let into the backstory.\n861\n0\n862\n0\n863\nI always cringe when people tell me they don't eat breakfast, as though that's a good thing.

Wake up every morning, decide what you feel like doing, and do it.\n999\n0\n1000\nI wrote a play before that and it never saw the light of day. And then I started working on this play and it came out really quickly. Eventually I got it, and I wrote a letter to Sarah Jessica Parker and she wanted to do it. So that's how it happened.\n1001\n0\n1002\n0\n1003\nI love the process of creating a character; someone entirely different from myself, and depicting it, either on stage or screen.\n1004\nOh yeah, I think about kids all the time. I feel like the next person I commit to, that's going to be the guy who I'm going to have kids with. That's in my crazy female brain. So that's why I'm like, 'I can't commit.'\n1005\n0\n1006\n0\n1007\n0\n1008\n0\n1009\nI think there are two sides of the coin. On one hand, it can be challenging to access different parts of yourself, and you kind of have to put yourself back into reality when you're done with the job. But I think it's also really cool to have the ability to try on being different people and to explore some parts of yourself because you get to know yourself better. You get to know parts of yourself that you haven't met before. I think that's something that I've been learning more recently.\n1010\n0\n1011\n0\n1012\nThe lack of economic freedom could be a very major reason for loss of liberty, liberty of life.\n1013\n0\n1014\n0\n1015\nI think people are starting to think of me less as an actor and more as a writer.\n1016\nSome of my best friends in LA are devoutly religious people. I'm completely supportive and interested in people doing their own thing. That's a motto that I try to live by, and I hope that's how other people treat me. Live and let live.\n1017\n0\n1018\nMaybe if I have another baby [I will grow my hair], because your hair grows super fast. I'll just grow it out and go natural for a minute.\n1019\n0\n1020\nI haven't had a lot of celebrities around me growing up.\n1021\nI wish the word supermodel would just fall off the face of the earth.

He didn't get on the phone easily. It's possible that he banished the phone from his desk. He was known to use it from time to time. The person who was hilarious with the phone was Hoover. He was a real engineer. He made a closed circuit phone where he could call the important people and they could call him, a government hotline, but it was closed. He shut out the possibility of input from people he didn't expect to get input from.\n1047\n0\n1048\n0\n1049\n0\n1050\nAny demanding high technology tends to develop influential and dedicated constituencies of those who link its commercial success with both the public welfare and their own. Such sincerely held beliefs, peer pressures, and the harsh demands that the work itself places on time and energy all tend to discourage such people from acquiring a similarly thorough knowledge of alternative policies and the need to discuss them.\n1051\nAs I've moved along - not only my life, but my career and things like that - you look at yourself and start going, 'Oh, man, are you still doing what you set out to do? Are the ideals you had still the same?' Sometimes you measure up and sometimes you don't.\n1052\n0\n1053\nThe [political] left are people with an imagination and the right are those without an imagination.\n1054\n0\n1055\n0\n1056\n0\n1057\n0\n1058\n0\n1059\nWhen I died my hair red the first time, I felt as if it was what nature intended. I have been accused of being a bit of a spitfire, so in that way, I absolutely live up to the stereotype. The red hair suits my personality.

It's a cool gift to get to talk to people about what they love.\n1092\n0\n1093\nI mean, I really, really love playing solo. Definitely, it's like a labor of love, it's not a huge career. It's not that successful, but it's something I love so much that I'll do it regardless.\n1094\n0\n1095\n0\n1096\n0\n1097\nThere are so many choices I made simply for health insurance. Is it the ideal role I wanted to play, or the TV show I wanted to be a part of? No, but it let me afford to go to the doctor.\n1098\nMy mom's always saying really smart things... like, you probably heard this one, 'Why buy the cow when the milk has HPV?' Wish I'd listened to that one.\n1099\nWhen you hear someone use the word 'meds' instead of the word 'medicine,' chances are they're no stranger to massive doses of mind-altering psychotropic drugs. Back out of the room slowly.\n1100\n0\n1101\n0\n1102\n0\n1103\nIt's a luxury being a writer, because all you ever think about is life.\n1104\n0\n1105\n0\n1106\n0\n1107\n0\n1108\n0\n1109\n0\n1110\n0\n1111\n0\n1112\n0\n1113\nYou know you have that zealousness of the young person that feels like you can go out and do it all. You know you save the world, save your gente, save women and before you know it if you try to do that you will burn out very quickly. My feeling is that I always think that and my advice to young people regardless of what times in these decades we've been living in there's always work to be done. The point is what can you do personally that you can live with so that you can get up the next morning and have the strength to start it all over again.\n1114\n0\n1115\n0\n1116\nI'm friends with a lot of actresses, but my 'SNL' friends are my closest. The experience of working there is something of a battleground, a great one, but complicated. I think there's a deep connection for having survived that workplace.\n1117\n0\n1118\n0\n1119\n0\n1120\n0\n1121\n0\n1122\n0\n1123\n0\n1124\n0\n1125\n0\n1126\n0\n1127\n0\n1128\n0\n1129\n0\n1130\n0\n1131\nFor the producers, there was no reason to produce. You get money, but you couldn't use this money. For consumers, you could have money, but you have no way to use it because you go to the shop and see nothing.\n1132\n0\n1133\n0\n1134\n0\n1135\n0\n1136\nConsensus and dialogue have always played a significant role, especially in Danish society. Of course there are basic values that must be respected, but within this framework, we are a liberal and tolerant country where everyone can live as they desire and according to their tradition. That is the Danish way.\n1137\n0\n1138\n0\n1139\nDo you get the anger that is out here?\n1140\n0\n1141\n0\n1142\nI'm in an unusual stage right now, because I haven't dated in so long. The sense of isolation turns it all into a bigger deal. Just taking the risk of opening that door is really hard for me right now.\n1143\n0\n1144\nI've been cheered by thousands, booed by thousands, but nothing feels as bad as the booing inside your own head during those ten minutes before you fall asleep.\n1145\n0\n1146\n0\n1147\n0\n1148\nYou download it for free, we get charged back for it.\nI know you're saying, \"They won't know, they won't miss it,\nBesides, I ain't a thief, they won't pay me a visit.\"\nSo, if I come to your job, take your corn on the cob,\nAnd take a couple kernels off it, that would be alright with you?\n1149\n0\n1150\n0\n1151\n0\n1152\n0\n1153\n0\n1154\n0\n1155\n0\n1156\n0\n1157\nDon't quit. It's very easy to quit during the first 10 years. Nobody cares whether you write or not, and it's very hard to write when nobody cares one way or the other. You can't get fired if you don't write, and most of the time you don't get rewarded if you do. But don't quit.\n1158\n0\n1159\n0\n1160\nIf I find great material, or a great character, or a great director that wants to do something on TV, or whether it's in film, or whatever it is, man - as long as it's good, and on the level, I'm open to it.\n1161\n0\n1162\n0\n1163\nRussia is a place of great culture. If you've read Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\", Dostoyevsky, Pushkin, Chekhov...the culture of the great Russian literature is amazing.

One thing I learned a long time ago is that you can't translate a book literally to the screen. It won't work because it's a different medium.

It confirmed that every crazy thing I'd ever done at least was staying true to the dreams of my youth - and really, I mean very young dreams of just being able to have fun all the time.\n1323\nA beautiful bouquet or a long-lasting flowering plant is a traditional gift for women, but I have recommended that both men and women keep fresh flowers in the home for their beauty, fragrance, and the lift they give our spirits.\n1324\n0\n1325\n0\n1326\n0\n1327\n0\n1328\n0\n1329\n0\n1330\nYou have to expect that if you cuss out the world, The world is going to cuss back.\n1331\n0\n1332\n0\n1333\n0\n1334\n0\n1335\n0\n1336\n0\n1337\n0\n1338\n0\n1339\n0\n1340\n0\n1341\n0\n1342\nEvery good thing that has happened in your life happened because something changed.\n1343\n0\n1344\n0\n1345\n0\n1346\nNever give in, never back down.\n1347\n0\n1348\n0\n1349\n0\n1350\nSometimes I get frustrated in traffic. I typically start going deep with my cab driver and Twitter feed - simultaneously - to take my mind off the gridlock. I enjoy live-tweeting my cab rides.\n1351\n0\n1352\n0\n1353\n0\n1354\nI believed in God my whole life, and then strayed away from it in my teen-age years, until recently.\n1355\n0\n1356\n0\n1357\n0\n1358\nIf you have the right actors and you can give them the freedom to explore, you've done a lot of your work as a director.\n1359\n0\n1360\n0\n1361\nGenerally in New York, people just walk over you with no problem about that. Other countries, people want to resuscitate you, like, after a bit.\n1362\n0\n1363\n0\n1364\n0\n1365\n0\n1366\n0\n1367\n0\n1368\n0\n1369\n0\n1370\n0\n1371\n0\n1372\n0\n1373\n0\n1374\n0\n1375\n0\n1376\n0\n1377\n0\n1378\n0\n1379\n0\n1380\n0\n1381\n0\n1382\n0\n1383\n0\n1384\nOne of the worst things sin did for man was to make him selfish, for selfishness cannot love.\n1385\n0\n1386\n0\n1387\nWill you tell them about that far off and mythical land And how a child to the virgin came? Will you tell them that the reason why we murdered Everything upon the surface of the world Is so we can stand right up and say we did it in his name?\n1388\n0\n1389\n0\n1390\n0\n1391\n0\n1392\nNo, I don't know any Emily Dickinson poems!\n1393\n0\n1394\n0\n1395\nNo matter how much it's growing, the Internet still is a pretty specific demographic. It doesn't necessarily represent the general populace. There is stuff that is blown up on the Internet that isn't hugely successful with the entire world, and vice versa. I don't put a tremendous amount of stock in it, but at the same time, you always want people to like what you're doing. Certainly, to have come from an Internet background, we want to stay faithful and have people be supportive and happy with what we're doing.\n1396\n0\n1397\nThere's this whole grey area seemingly every time it's talked about animators and who takes ultimate responsibility for the characters [of the Planet of the apes] but without question and I'll go down saying this year after year, these characters are authored by what we do on set. They are not authored by animators.\n1398\n0\n1399\nA single act of courage is often the tipping point for extraordinary change.\n1400\n0\n1401\n0\n1402\nUsually, the best thing is when the band goes to the bar and gets the corner table, we sit there like kings, and then they bring people to us. It's just rock 'n' roll. It's stupid, really.\n1403\n0\n1404\n0\n1405\n0\n1406\n0\n1407\n0\n1408\n0\n1409\n0\n1410\n0\n1411\n0\n1412\nI like to think I'm un-categorisable.\n1413\n0\n1414\n0\n1415\n0\n1416\n0\n1417\n0\n1418\n0\n1419\n0\n1420\nI feel really good about the future and working with people.\n1421\n0\n1422\n0\n1423\n0\n1424\n0\n1425\nMemories are meant to fade, Lenny.

This crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money and it was not sustainable growth.\n1440\n0\n1441\n0\n1442\n0\n1443\n0\n1444\nIt's easier to be with somebody. But it's better to be single if you're with the wrong person.\n1445\n0\n1446\nI want to look at myself in the mirror at the end of my life and say I've done my share and I'm proud of what I've done.\n1447\n0\n1448\n0\n1449\n0\n1450\n0\n1451\n0\n1452\n0\n1453\n0\n1454\n0\n1455\nI think the thing that made this stand out the most was just the fact that there's a lot more character to these characters. We see their back stories and we see their present situations, and that was a lot more interesting than just the regular procedural with four heads standing around a body, spelling it out for you. It's a lot more of a roller coaster ride.\n1456\n0\n1457\n0\n1458\n0\n1459\n0\n1460\n0\n1461\n0\n1462\n0\n1463\n0\n1464\n0\n1465\n0\n1466\n0\n1467\n0\n1468\nThere's a paradox in every paradigm.\n1469\n0\n1470\n0\n1471\n0\n1472\n0\n1473\n0\n1474\n0\n1475\n0\n1476\n0\n1477\nIf you get a bad review, you take that in your stride.\n1478\n0\n1479\n0\n1480\n0\n1481\n0\n1482\n0\n1483\n0\n1484\n0\n1485\nWhether we call it a job or a career, work is more than just something we do.

We like to be loved, and we'll do anything if we're loved.\n1500\n0\n1501\n0\n1502\n0\n1503\n0\n1504\n0\n1505\nJust as we're always told that schoolyard bullies are actually deeply insecure, liberals rationalize their own ferocious behavior by claiming to have been wounded somehow. What about the little guy our poor, insecure bully is beating the living daylights out of? How's his self-esteem coming along? That is the essence of liberals: They viciously attack everyone else, while wailing that they are the victims.\n1506\n0\n1507\n0\n1508\n0\n1509\n0\n1510\nThis planet seems to be in such sorry shape. And I can't ever think about the rest of the universe without coming back home and thinking what the implications for life here would be if we were to really have some definitive proof of extraterrestrial life.\n1511\n0\n1512\n0\n1513\n0\n1514\n0\n1515\n0\n1516\n0\n1517\n0\n1518\n0\n1519\n0\n1520\n0\n1521\n0\n1522\n0\n1523\n0\n1524\n0\n1525\nThere can be something cruel about people who have had good fortune. They equate it with personal goodness.\n1526\n0\n1527\n0\n1528\nYou can never ask God to tell you what the end is. You can ask, \"Is this a good thing to do?\" But not, \"How is this going to turn out?\" That answer you will never get.\n1529\n0\n1530\n0\n1531\n0\n1532\n0\n1533\n...the secret to joy is to keep seeking God where we doubt He is.\n1534\n0\n1535\n0\n1536\n0\n1537\n0\n1538\n0\n1539\n0\n1540\n0\n1541\n0\n1542\n0\n1543\n0\n1544\n0\n1545\n0\n1546\nI had no idea of the size of my bank account as a teen, and I didn't care to know. That was my mom's job, I figured that I would just find out when I turned 18. If you can't trust your mom, then who can you trust?\n1547\nI think we can learn a lot about a person in the very moment that language fails them. In the very moment they they have to be more creative than they would have imagined in order to communicate. It's the very moment that they have to dig deeper than the surface to find words, and at the same time, it's a moment when they want to communicate very badly. They're digging deep and projecting out at the same time.\n1548\n0\n1549\n0\n1550\nI try not to read newspapers when I have a movie coming out, but I guess I'm not immune to public opinion. I'm hurt by it.\n1551\n0\n1552\nI want more children but for the next three years I want to act.\n1553\n0\n1554\n0\n1555\n0\n1556\n0\n1557\n0\n1558\nThe most common thing that I get is, ‘Am I the only one who doesn’t think that Anna Kendrick is pretty? And youre like, ‘No, you’re not the only one. Arguably, all of the boys in my high school agree with you.’\n1559\n0\n1560\n0\n1561\n0\n1562\n0\n1563\n0\n1564\n0\n1565\nNone of the characters I`ve played are really like me. That would be boring. It wouldn`t be acting.\n1566\n0\n1567\nThat's really what I want in a leader; I want somebody who's really, really smart.\n1568\n0\n1569\n0\n1570\nI think about that all of the time and I have this fantasy that I am going to work at a museum someday! I would love to do something like that!\n1571\n0\n1572\n0\n1573\n0\n1574\n0\n1575\n0\n1576\n0\n1577\n0\n1578\n0\n1579\n0\n1580\nI don't like a lot of crazy makeup.\n1581\n0\n1582\n0\n1583\nI didn't like doing predictions. It's certainly true that right now - and this could change tomorrow - but, right now there is no clear way for Putin to lose power. There seems little chance that a street revolution could unseat him; that's just not how things are going to work in Russia. And it seems as if the very tiny number of people who control the economy and who control politics in Russia are loyal to him.\n1584\n0\n1585\n0\n1586\n0\n1587\n0\n1588\n0\n1589\n0\n1590\n0\n1591\n0\n1592\nSometimes I dream a sentence and write it down. It’s usually nonsense, but sometimes it seems a key to another world.\n1593\n0\n1594\n0\n1595\n0\n1596\n0\n1597\nI do not think we remember our family in any real sense. We live in them instead\n1598\n0\n1599\n0\n1600\n0\n1601\n0\n1602\n0\n1603\n0\n1604\n0\n1605\n0\n1606\n0\n1607\n0\n1608\nGod knows that sometimes we lack words to express our feelings, heart-cry, thoughts. And so within the Bible he includes people's prayers as models to help our own.\n1609\nYour face needs to have character if you're an actor - otherwise you're just a face.\n1610\nI believe I went through a divorce. My relationship with Ellen is no less significant as a marriage than my relationship to Coley.\n1611\n0\n1612\n0\n1613\n0\n1614\nLaughter is carbonated holiness.\n1615\n0\n1616\n0\n1617\n0\n1618\n0\n1619\n0\n1620\n0\n1621\n0\n1622\n0\n1623\n0\n1624\nGive me a man or woman who has read a thousand books and you give me an interesting companion. Give me a man or woman who has read perhaps three and you give me a very dangerous enemy indeed.\n1625\n0\n1626\nMy favourite designers are Alexander McQueen, YSL, Eskandar, Donna Karan and Lanvin.\n1627\nFriendship needs both confidences and confidence in the other's outstretched hand.\n1628\n0\n1629\n0\n1630\n0\n1631\n0\n1632\nThe value of the television network is partly tradition, serving as a navigation device and as a brand. Research shows that people do know and understand ABC as a brand, like Disney.\n1633\n0\n1634\nI'm beginning to think that maybe it's not just how much you love someone. Maybe what matters is who you are when you're with them.\n1635\nCertainly the beat writers I've known who carried forward the original, you know, I'd say that came together in the 1940s and 50s. So I was inheriting in a way some of that ethos.\n1636\n0\n1637\n0\n1638\nYou just grow up and learn to think instead of just feel.\n1639\nI very much admire Sheryl Sandberg for what she has done. I really do. But Sandberg's narrative also implies: \"Well, it's your fault if you couldn't make it.\" There is a certain injustice in that.\n1640\n0\n1641\n0\n1642\n0\n1643\n0\n1644\n0\n1645\nOf course, you can never watch something like somebody else watches something like you, but nonetheless, you have to try. So I think on camera you learn a lot about how much the camera does for you, which is what is the great luxury of movie acting. Or acting whether it's TV or movies or whatever it is, that the camera's really such a gift because there's so much that it sees and does if you're willing to just be open and expose yourself and all of that. So you also learn what doesn't matter. And sometimes when you think about things, you think things matter that don't matter.\n1646\n0\n1647\n0\n1648\n0\n1649\n0\n1650\n0\n1651\n0\n1652\nNature seems to exult in abounding radicality, extremism, anarchy. If we were to judge nature by its common sense or likelihood, we wouldn't believe the world existed. In nature, improbabilities are the one stock in trade. The whole creation is one lunatic fringe. ... No claims of any and all revelations could be so far-fetched as a single giraffe.\n1653\n0\n1654\nChecking voicemail is like, \"When's the other shoe going to drop?\" I'm always afraid it's going to be terrible news I don't want to hear.\n1655\n0\n1656\n0\n1657\n0\n1658\n0\n1659\n0\n1660\nWe're not interested to know the real heroes. We're really more interested in the villains, actually, and they seem to thrive, and it continues to be business as usual.\n1661\n0\n1662\n0\n1663\n0\n1664\n0\n1665\n0\n1666\n0\n1667\n0\n1668\n0\n1669\n0\n1670\nI wasn't frightened going to outer space. I'd been living this in my head for many, many years, so I sort of had played all of these scenarios of flying into space and seeing earth. I think I was very prepared for it. It was almost a completely joyful, very happy, very exciting experience, and I didn't have time or any desire to think about what things could go wrong.\n1671\n0\n1672\n0\n1673\nI have a lot of weird interests, but everything I do is artistic.\n1674\n0\n1675\n0\n1676\n0\n1677\n0\n1678\nI don't know how to put on any tough guy pretensions.\n1679\n0\n1680\n0\n1681\nI have made six big home moves in my life and I have never lost money on one I have lived in.\n1682\n0\n1683\n0\n1684\n0\n1685\nIf you respect the art and you have some talent about you, I'm on your team.\n1686\n0\n1687\nI'm excited by any food that's prepared by someone who's proud of what they're doing, who puts a personal imprint on food.\n1688\n0\n1689\n0\n1690\n0\n1691\n0\n1692\n0\n1693\n0\n1694\n0\n1695\n0\n1696\n0\n1697\n0\n1698\nIt took me about three years to write About Grace. I wasn't teaching two of those years, so I was working eight-hour days, five days a week. And it would include research and reading - it wasn't just a blank page, laying down words.\n1699\n0\n1700\n0\n1701\n0\n1702\n0\n1703\n0\n1704\n0\n1705\n0\n1706\n0\n1707\n0\n1708\n0\n1709\n0\n1710\n0\n1711\n0\n1712\n0\n1713\n0\n1714\n0\n1715\nWhy love, if losing hurts so much? I have no answers anymore: only the life I have lived... The pain now is part of the happiness then.\n1716\n0\n1717\n0\n1718\nMy girlfriend makes me want to be a better person... so I can get a better girlfriend.\n1719\n0\n1720\n0\n1721\n0\n1722\nA certain amount of volatility and drama can me healthy and keep things fun and interesting if you're willing at any moment during a fight to say, 'This means nothing. I love you, let's forget about it.\n1723\n0\n1724\n0\n1725\n0\n1726\n0\n1727\n0\n1728\nThere was this rapper from New Orleans, Mystikal, who when I hear his music, I hear myself. Whenever I wanna get hyped, I put on Mystikal.\n1729\n0\n1730\n0\n1731\n0\n1732\n0\n1733\n0\n1734\n0\n1735\n0\n1736\n0\n1737\n0\n1738\n0\n1739\nInvestigating rare diseases gives researchers more clues about how the healthy immune system functions.\n1740\nThere are people inside the administration that think it is their job to save America from the President. That is not their job. Their job is to inject this President into America so that he can explain his views properly and his policies so that we can transform America and drain the swamp and make the system fairer for the middle and lower income people.\n1741\n0\n1742\n0\n1743\n0\n1744\n0\n1745\n0\n1746\n0\n1747\n0\n1748\n0\n1749\n0\n1750\nIt's a dumb question, because I don't look at things as a black director, just as a director, so ask me as a director first and we can segue into the colour thing later.\n1751\n0\n1752\nIt's only when people get involved, when there's money involved, that you have a lot opinions around you. I try not to listen to them too much.\n1753\n0\n1754\n0\n1755\n0\n1756\n0\n1757\n0\n1758\n0\n1759\n0\n1760\n0\n1761\n0\n1762\n0\n1763\n0\n1764\n0\n1765\nI discovered very soon, especially for movies, because I started in theater, that every director has his own universe. You have to be free enough to try to understand what he wants from you. Especially when that director has a tremendous personality. And I'm talking about people like Pedro Almodovar and Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino and Woody Allen. And you have to adapt. If you don't adapt to them, you are off the thing.\n1766\n0\n1767\n0\n1768\nConsciousness permits us to develop the instruments of culture - morality and justice, religion, art, economics and politics, science and technology. Those instruments allow us some measure of freedom in the confrontation with nature.\n1769\n0\n1770\n0\n1771\n0\n1772\n0\n1773\n0\n1774\n0\n1775\n0\n1776\n0\n1777\n0\n1778\n0\n1779\n0\n1780\n0\n1781\n0\n1782\n0\n1783\n0\n1784\n0\n1785\n0\n1786\n0\n1787\n0\n1788\n0\n1789\n0\n1790\n0\n1791\n0\n1792\n0\n1793\n0\n1794\nThere is more to Indian cinema than just Bollywood. I think regional cinema, especially Tamil and Marathi cinema are exploring some really bold themes.\n1795\n0\n1796\n0\n1797\n0\n1798\n0\n1799\n0\n1800\n0\n1801\n0\n1802\nI used to love jungle. I still think it's the ultimate genre, really, because the people making it weren't musicians.\n1803\n0\n1804\n0\n1805\nThe older I get, the more and more I notice I'm like my father. It's funny, because when I was younger I tried to just back away from my father as much as I could, and some of the philosophies, some of the life lessons, some of the beliefs that he had within me are always constantly ongoing, and they're always prevalent in my life, whether it's trying to be every single thing that I can be in my sport or life or relationship or business, whatever avenue I'm pursuing.\n1806\n0\n1807\n0\n1808\n0\n1809\n0\n1810\n0\n1811\n0\n1812\n0\n1813\n0\n1814\n0\n1815\n0\n1816\n0\n1817\n0\n1818\n0\n1819\n0\n1820\n0\n1821\n0\n1822\n0\n1823\nA White Tiger keeps no friends.

Maybe less in life and in love, but in work and in comedic beats, I feel pretty confident.\n1837\n0\n1838\n0\n1839\n0\n1840\n0\n1841\n0\n1842\n0\n1843\nI've done the bad-boy thing. It was fun for a good three months.

Every dream carries with it certain risks, especially the risk of failure. But I am not stopped by risks. Supposed a great person takes the risk and fails. Then the person must try again. You cannot fail forever. If you try ten times, you have a better chance of making it on the eleventh try than if you didn't try at all.\n1901\n0\n1902\n0\n1903\n0\n1904\n0\n1905\n0\n1906\n0\n1907\n0\n1908\n0\n1909\n0\n1910\n0\n1911\n0\n1912\n0\n1913\n0\n1914\n0\n1915\n0\n1916\n0\n1917\n0\n1918\n0\n1919\nI would say that, in the future, the book will be reserved for things that function best as a book. So, if I need a textbook that's going to be out of date because of new technological inventions, you're better off having it where you can download the supplements or the update. If you're going to read a quick mystery novel to keep you amused while you're traveling, it's fine.\n1920\n0\n1921\n0\n1922\n0\n1923\n0\n1924\n0\n1925\n0\n1926\n0\n1927\n0\n1928\n0\n1929\n0\n1930\n0\n1931\n0\n1932\n0\n1933\n0\n1934\n0\n1935\n0\n1936\n0\n1937\n0\n1938\n0\n1939\n0\n1940\n0\n1941\n0\n1942\n0\n1943\n0\n1944\n0\n1945\n0\n1946\n0\n1947\n0\n1948\n0\n1949\n0\n1950\n0\n1951\n0\n1952\n0\n1953\n0\n1954\n0\n1955\n0\n1956\n0\n1957\n0\n1958\n0\n1959\n0\n1960\n0\n1961\n0\n1962\n0\n1963\n0\n1964\n0\n1965\n0\n1966\n0\n1967\n0\n1968\n0\n1969\n0\n1970\nThe idea of justice - even just dreaming of justice - is revolutionary. The language of human rights tends to accept a status quo that is intrinsically unjust - and then tries to make it more accountable.\n1971\n0\n1972\n0\n1973\n0\n1974\n0\n1975\n0\n1976\n0\n1977\n0\n1978\nThe most exciting thing in England is a pigeon or foxes, which isn't very interesting to watch because everyone knows what they do.

It's a lot of stipulations and constraints placed on you. What makes it worse is that, in terms of distributing budgets, labels aren't even giving the same amount as they used to. It totally defeats the purpose. My advice would be to get it out there on your own first which will lead you to calling the shots.\n1989\n0\n1990\nYou guys are always going off about how much money you have. Do you realize what's going on in this world right now?' All these black rappers? African rappers? Talking about how much money they have. Do you realize what's going on in Africa right now? It's just like, you guys are disgusting. Talking about billions and billions of dollars you have. And spending it frivolously, when you know, the Motherland is suffering beyond belief right now.\n1991\n0\n1992\n0\n1993\n0\n1994\n0\n1995\n0\n1996\n0\n1997\n0\n1998\nI get really cool gifts, and I know this sounds really lame, but I think one of the best gifts I've ever received was the Easy Bake Oven when I was younger. When I was little, I loved to bake! I want to get one now so I can make weird mini desserts for people.\n1999\n0\n2000\n0\n2001\n0\n2002\n0\n2003\nI think with vampires, you can't really go wrong. For generations, vampires have been a hit because they're unobtainable, mysterious, sensual, dangerous, kind of sexy.\n2004\n0\n2005\nI do quite like sightseeing. I like churches, museums, galleries and all that stuff. I love the smell of a church in Italy or the smell of an old greasy spoon somewhere. I like markets and little funny shops in the backstreets of Florence.\n2006\n0\n2007\nMy mothers into frilly dresses and eyelashes and hairstyles from the 1970s. We always argue about that.\n2008\n0\n2009\n0\n2010\n0\n2011\nMy collections are a reflection of my personal style and interests. All the textiles, fabrics and patterns are of my personal choice.\n2012\n0\n2013\n0\n2014\n0\n2015\n0\n2016\nI love pancakes, and I actually do love healthy stuff.

I think every day should be a day of romance. Then, on Valentine's Day, you should get to tell whoever you hate that you cannot stand them. There would be one day of hating, and 364 days of love.\n2030\n0\n2031\n0\n2032\n0\n2033\n0\n2034\n0\n2035\n0\n2036\nThere is no journalist without opinions, and there's no real objectivity, but we can strive toward it.\n2037\n0\n2038\n0\n2039\n0\n2040\n0\n2041\n0\n2042\n0\n2043\n0\n2044\n0\n2045\n0\n2046\n0\n2047\n0\n2048\n0\n2049\n0\n2050\n0\n2051\n0\n2052\nOne of the huge advantages of shooting in the winter is that locations that wouldn't have been available to us suddenly were, like Yorkville. ... It's just specific streets and specific angles. I think that's what's always kind of shocking about some cities: they are really about intersections.\n2053\n0\n2054\n0\n2055\n0\n2056\n0\n2057\nMy own son has a congenital heart condition, where his life was saved by a cardiac surgeon stepping in at 11 days of life to save his life. But he is now 21 years old because of constant monitoring and working with him with a primary care physician. that's the only reason now that he's getting to live a long and healthy life. That's what we're not rewarding. They don't have the kind of resources and commitment that we are giving to people like me. I have millions of dollars of equipment available to me when I go to work every day in an operating room.\n2058\n0\n2059\n0\n2060\n0\n2061\nI got off Twitter, because I started feeling like it was not adding anything positive into my life. If anything, it was more negative. But now I'm back on it because it can be fun. I think, as an actor and a public figure, it's a different experience when you put yourself out there in that way. I think it can be a great tool, and that part I'm comfortable with. But the part that's kind of more personal, that part I'm still struggling with, because I don't really want people to know everything about me.\n2062\nAnybody from the public can come in and observe ballots being processed and those votes being counted in elections officials' offices in any county in any state in the nation.\n2063\nI think for a lot of people that are in performing arts, it's easy to fall into the trap of starting to confuse what's real life and what's not, because to your body it's all real.\n2064\n0\n2065\n0\n2066\n0\n2067\nI don't want to become more famous than what I am. I'm not interested in being in movies that are going to be shown all around the world and get a massive audience, so I'm interested in doing foreign movies as long as it stays an exceptional case and is exotic, but I don't want to go there [Hollywood].\n2068\n0\n2069\n0\n2070\n0\n2071\n0\n2072\nBut she did love him. I believe it. I know exactly how that is. To love somebody who doesn't deserve it. Because they are all you have. Because any attention is better than no attention.\n2073\n0\n2074\n0\n2075\nGovernment leaders are amazing. So often it seems they are the last to know what the people want.\n2076\n0\n2077\n0\n2078\n0\n2079\n0\n2080\n0\n2081\n0\n2082\n0\n2083\n0\n2084\n0\n2085\n0\n2086\n0\n2087\n0\n2088\n0\n2089\n0\n2090\n0\n2091\n0\n2092\n0\n2093\nI didn't start out thinking that I could ever make films. I started out being a film lover, loving films, and wanting to have a job that put me close to them and close to filmmakers and close to film sets.\n2094\n0\n2095\n0\n2096\n0\n2097\n0\n2098\n0\n2099\n0\n2100\n0\n2101\n0\n2102\nIt makes a world of difference when you start with an amazing script.\n2103\n0\n2104\n0\n2105\n0\n2106\nA lot of work and thinking goes into my DJing. I want the entire night to progress seamlessly and when I have to adapt the energy on the fly for the crowd on any given night, I can do so with harmonic mixes that Ive practiced over and over again. I am far from the only DJ that does this and its something I take pride in being able to do.\n2107\n0\n2108\n0\n2109\n0\n2110\n0\n2111\n0\n2112\n0\n2113\n0\n2114\nI'm the kind of person who always likes to be doing something.\n2115\n0\n2116\n0\n2117\nI feel I have a responsibility to myself, a responsibility to explain where we're coming from. Because a song or the performance of a song is a lot like a work of art.\n2118\n0\n2119\nThe worst feeling in the world is giving a bad audition.\n2120\n0\n2121\nLiberal capitalism is not perfect, but compared to the other 'isms,' it's far superior.\n2122\n0\n2123\n0\n2124\n0\n2125\n0\n2126\n0\n2127\nThe capacity for extravagant emotion that my husband finds so attractive in me can be exhausting, especially to a child. My moods are mercurial, and this can be terrifying. I know, because I was a daughter of a mother with a changeable temperament.\n2128\n0\n2129\n0\n2130\n0\n2131\n0\n2132\n0\n2133\n0\n2134\n0\n2135\n0\n2136\n0\n2137\n0\n2138\n0\n2139\n0\n2140\n0\n2141\n0\n2142\nIf you look up feminist in the dictionary, it just means someone who believes men and women have equal rights.\n2143\n0\n2144\n0\n2145\n0\n2146\n0\n2147\n0\n2148\n0\n2149\n0\n2150\n0\n2151\n0\n2152\n0\n2153\n0\n2154\n0\n2155\n0\n2156\n0\n2157\nYou can physically move yourself around but there's that great line that Adam wrote: \"Does it define for life, like print of thumb?\" I think it does.\n2158\n0\n2159\n0\n2160\n0\n2161\n0\n2162\n0\n2163\n0\n2164\nI'm one of the best actresses.

Instinct is a lifesaver for sharks and entrepreneurs alike. Most people can recall times they ignored their gut only to regret it later. Learning to actually listen to your instinct is a great form of self-preservation. It's both incredibly easy and tough at the same time, but worth the effort to master.\n2200\n0\n2201\n0\n2202\n0\n2203\n0\n2204\n0\n2205\n0\n2206\n0\n2207\nMedical debts are the number-one cause of bankruptcy in America.\n2208\n0\n2209\n0\n2210\n0\n2211\n0\n2212\n0\n2213\n0\n2214\n0\n2215\n0\n2216\nThe arc of history is longer than human vision. It bends. We abolished slavery, we granted universal suffrage. We have done hard things before. And every time it took a terrible fight between people who could not imagine changing the rules, and those who said, 'We already did. We have made the world new.' The hardest part will be to convince yourself of the possibilities, and hang on.\n2217\n0\n2218\n0\n2219\n0\n2220\n0\n2221\n0\n2222\nThe great human problem of evil stems from the illusion of separateness. Whenever this illusion is overcome, we behave lovingly to one another.\n2223\n0\n2224\nI think Paul Sarbanes and his wife Christine socialized with them [George and Heather Mitchell] more than I did, but we all hung out, or we saw each other in groups.\n2225\n0\n2226\n0\n2227\n0\n2228\n0\n2229\n0\n2230\n0\n2231\n0\n2232\n0\n2233\n0\n2234\n0\n2235\n0\n2236\n0\n2237\nWait for those unguarded moments.

When they announced that Val Kilmer was going to be Batman, everyone was mad. When it was announced that George Clooney was going to be Batman, everyone was mad. When it was announced that Christian Bale was going to be Batman, everyone was mad. And everyone was mad about Ben Affleck.

But those books were there for me at a very important point in my life.\n2413\n0\n2414\n0\n2415\n0\n2416\n0\n2417\nThe good news is at this point as I get older, the load has gotten heavier but my shoulders have gotten wider because I've gotten happier so it's a damn good thing.\n2418\n0\n2419\n0\n2420\n0\n2421\n0\n2422\n0\n2423\n0\n2424\n0\n2425\n0\n2426\nIf one is going to offer children stories that underneath the story must be something that will inform, stimulate and guide, I love to be on board. I think anything that resonates with history, as does The Jungle Book and Watership Down, reflects patterns of behavior, power struggles, deprivation, migration, survival, joy, love, betrayal, and all of these things. It's tragic that children are encouraged to ignore history. We ignore history and any literature that is historically based in history. Even though both of those films involved animals, of course they reflect human behavior.\n2427\n0\n2428\n0\n2429\nI like to think - knowing that it's an enabling fiction - of those moments as fragments from a world to come, a world where price isn't the only measure of value.\n2430\n0\n2431\n0\n2432\n0\n2433\nSuspense left my life a long time ago, now it has returned.

Can you do five days on it?\" And I was like, \"Yeah, anything. Twenty-four hours times five is 120 hours. Oh, great, I'll fill 120 hours of my life with something.\" So I did that and it was fun, and then I did Flirting with Disaster.\n2463\n0\n2464\n0\n2465\n0\n2466\n0\n2467\nWhen you have a character to work with, you carry them around in a strange way - they make you look at the world in a different way.\n2468\n0\n2469\n0\n2470\n0\n2471\n0\n2472\nMetaphorically speaking, it's easy to bump into one another on the journey from A to B and not even notice.

I was a Marvel boy.\n2488\nI always say if God didn't allow any bad things to happen, we would already be in heaven. And we are not there. That's where trust and faith comes in. You just say, \"Lord, I don't understand it. But one thing I do know is that you understand it and that you are in control and I trust you.\"\n2489\n0\n2490\nConfidence came from people.

Refugees of all kinds were constantly fleeing from Christendom to the Islamic lands. Jews of course and Muslims of course, but even some Christians and the movement of refugees went overwhelmingly that way.\n2554\n0\n2555\n0\n2556\n0\n2557\n0\n2558\n0\n2559\n0\n2560\n0\n2561\n0\n2562\nEven if it doesn't sound like it at first, that's an identity that Europe can go out into the world with and take a leading role.\n2563\n0\n2564\n0\n2565\nI don't see my movies.

If you ask me to name five of our team, I couldn't. There's that guy who scores goals - Taarabt. Routledge I've heard of. All bloody nice guys but I don't mix with them so I don't know them well.

People think being happy will just happen to them someday, if only they do this or that right. But it doesn't - you have to choose it.

The men are contemptuous of the women, and the women really need to organize. She writes an article which becomes an article she writes in different ways over and over and over again: Women need to organize. They need to create their own bosses. They need to have support networks and gangs so that they are a force.\n2935\n0\n2936\n0\n2937\n0\n2938\nActors are very generous.\n2939\n0\n2940\n0\n2941\n0\n2942\nWe're having a traditional Thanksgiving - turkey, mashed potatoes, hat buckles, smallpox, genocide, a blue corn moon, etc.\n2943\n0\n2944\nWhen you trust your director completely, then you can relax, be spontaneous, be malleable.\n2945\n0\n2946\n0\n2947\n0\n2948\nBut now in this day and age, people are more prone to go out to try new things to enhance their performance on the field - to enhance their physical appearance.\n2949\n0\n2950\n0\n2951\n0\n2952\n0\n2953\n0\n2954\n0\n2955\n0\n2956\n0\n2957\n0\n2958\n0\n2959\n0\n2960\n0\n2961\n0\n2962\n0\n2963\nMoveOn loves government. It remains enamored of government spending as fuel for its liberal agenda; and anything that threatens to close that spigot in any degree is perceived as a dire threat - worthy of Chicken-Little warnings that the sky is going to fall.\n2964\n0\n2965\n0\n2966\n0\n2967\n0\n2968\n0\n2969\n0\n2970\n0\n2971\n0\n2972\n0\n2973\n0\n2974\n0\n2975\n0\n2976\n0\n2977\n0\n2978\n0\n2979\n0\n2980\n0\n2981\n0\n2982\n0\n2983\n0\n2984\n0\n2985\n0\n2986\n0\n2987\n0\n2988\nWith all the divisive forces tearing at our country, we need the glue of language to help hold us together. If we want to ensure that all our children have the same opportunities in life, alternative language education should stop and English should be acknowledged once and for all as the official language of the United States.\n2989\n0\n2990\n0\n2991\nWhat's money?

And it did seem to me that one way that we could bring the apartheid regime down would be if we did mount an effective investment sanction.\n3016\n0\n3017\n0\n3018\n0\n3019\n0\n3020\n0\n3021\n0\n3022\n0\n3023\n0\n3024\n0\n3025\n0\n3026\n0\n3027\n0\n3028\n0\n3029\n0\n3030\n0\n3031\n0\n3032\n0\n3033\nMilitary families so much appreciate the love, support and prayers.\n3034\n0\n3035\n0\n3036\n0\n3037\n0\n3038\n0\n3039\n0\n3040\n0\n3041\n0\n3042\n0\n3043\nComedy can be destructive, and still very, very funny. But if I can do something that is fun to watch and critical of the world but not wantonly destructive, I pursue those kinds of ideas more. The world needs less destruction.

The critics hated it. They said terrible, terrible things about it. But it should have been reviewed by ten-year-olds. That's who it was made for. They loved it. And if they loved it, great. Why the hell does a fifty-year-old guy working at a big newspaper have to tell me I'm a piece of crap?\n3057\n0\n3058\n0\n3059\n0\n3060\nWhether or not the President is sleeping well won't be a factor in his re-election.

In every place of the world our body has a different significance.\n3140\nAt this point in my career, I have the privilege of choosing my partners. In the beginning, you more or less take what comes in the door - or what matches up with your brand. But you're always subject to what's available, especially in the ski world where there are not infinite choices, especially on the fashion side.\n3141\n0\n3142\n0\n3143\n0\n3144\n0\n3145\n0\n3146\n0\n3147\n0\n3148\n0\n3149\n0\n3150\n0\n3151\n0\n3152\n0\n3153\n0\n3154\n0\n3155\n0\n3156\n0\n3157\nIt's really liberating and fun to be writing stuff for myself, and really have the freedom to say what I want to say and not really have to think about what somebody else is going to say or have to edit myself to speak from someone else's vision.\n3158\nThe challenge of course is in sobriety and that's been the blessing, to realize, to take accountability for the ways that your own thinking impacts your happiness, and your serenity, and your ability to be a productive and a loving, giving member of your family and society.\n3159\n0\n3160\n0\n3161\n0\n3162\n0\n3163\n0\n3164\n0\n3165\n0\n3166\n0\n3167\n0\n3168\n0\n3169\nSkid marks all across my brain, cause you're leaving me with so much pain. I was pretty sure that you could be the one, now it is evident that it was hit and run.\n3170\n0\n3171\n0\n3172\nWe should celebrate immigrants and everything they do for our country.\n3173\nI don't put on a face. I'm the same guy every time you see me. I like to laugh, I like to smile, and I don't take myself too seriously. I can be a goofball. When I come home, the only thing that changes is that I take off the suit and put on tennis shorts and play with the kids.\n3174\n0\n3175\n0\n3176\n0\n3177\n0\n3178\nNow we know more about it and we teach our children not to get into cars with strangers but back then it was you know people didn't really use to that mentality yet.\n3179\nI love my fans very much. They give me the confidence to continue things in life.\n3180\n0\n3181\nWhen I go onstage, I'm going to work ...I feel like my performance is about an emotional connection. I want to connect with people, whether it's like a romantic song or a happy song.\n3182\n0\n3183\n0\n3184\n0\n3185\n0\n3186\n0\n3187\nEven in hand drawn animation, humans are widely considered to be the most difficult to execute, because everybody has a feeling for how they move.\n3188\n0\n3189\n0\n3190\n0\n3191\n0\n3192\n0\n3193\n0\n3194\n0\n3195\n0\n3196\n0\n3197\n0\n3198\n0\n3199\n0\n3200\n0\n3201\n0\n3202\n0\n3203\n0\n3204\n0\n3205\n0\n3206\nThere are a lot of nice details that are exclusive to C. Wonder, which are the status C. Wonder gold buttons and the tassels. We want the customer and the loyal client to just really know that when they come to C.

This comes from somebody who had been sort of an alpha male, highly cynical war correspondent, who had basically seen it all and heard it all, was cynical and trusted nothing.\n3238\nI'll be honest with you, one of the things that frustrated me the most out the record leak thing, it had nothing to do with record sales - I mean, that's a joke. Has anybody looked at how many records anybody sells anymore? If you're not Jay-Z, a record leaking isn't going to affect you. It was just really personal.\n3239\n0\n3240\n0\n3241\nLife's complicated and people do things for a lot of reasons. I think if you live in a black-and-white world, you're gonna suffer a lot. I used to be like that. But I don't believe that anymore.\n3242\n0\n3243\n0\n3244\n0\n3245\n0\n3246\n0\n3247\nI did not always agree, personally, on the positions that Bartlet, character from the West Wing, took and I argued against them on many occasions. But Aaron Sorkin said, \"Martin, that's you, that's not Barlet. It's a very political decision he has to make.\" I found from the very beginning that when I infused my own personal feelings about an issue it went against the grain of the character.\n3248\n0\n3249\n0\n3250\n0\n3251\n0\n3252\n0\n3253\n0\n3254\n0\n3255\n0\n3256\n0\n3257\nSometimes seeming happy can be self-destructive even when you're sane.\n3258\nSo along with that is spending a lot of time with the ball. For me it was, I loved to juggle the ball in my front yard, and I always challenged myself - how many juggles can I get today? I think for players to get better, it's just about spending the time.\n3259\n0\n3260\n0\n3261\nUnfortunately, the simplest things - such as thinking for myself, creating my own reality and being whatever the hell I want to be each day of my life - are a sin. To be a good Christian basically means to give up the reigns of your life and let some unseen force do it for you.\n3262\n0\n3263\n0\n3264\n0\n3265\n0\n3266\n0\n3267\n0\n3268\n0\n3269\n0\n3270\n0\n3271\n0\n3272\n0\n3273\n0\n3274\nI'm very excited to see where the characters and their relationships go. But in the end, it really boils down to the people who have more power than me, who control the money.\n3275\n0\n3276\n0\n3277\n0\n3278\n0\n3279\n0\n3280\n0\n3281\n0\n3282\nI certainly didn't want to date.

A sense that you have a dream for yourself that you believe can happen.\n3330\n0\n3331\nI'm not starting my own religion, I'm not preaching, and I'm not starting a church of any kind, but I love being able to accumulate so many experiences over the years and use that as ammunition for what I truly believe in.\n3332\nEffort + the courage to show up = enough.\n3333\n0\n3334\n0\n3335\n0\n3336\nThe UN could help the Iraqi government get on its feet and help the United States withdraw a bit more.\n3337\n0\n3338\n0\n3339\nI know a guy who writes on the show, it was his episode, and he called and said, \"Would you do it?\" And I said, \"Yeah.\" There's not really much else to tell, except that I was thrilled to be on The Simpsons, because it's one of the greatest series in the history of television.\n3340\n0\n3341\n0\n3342\n0\n3343\n0\n3344\nA child should never even think about being a \"good son.\" A parent decides that fate for the child.

For some reason, chewing gum for me gets my brain going.\n3517\n0\n3518\n0\n3519\nI have found out that friendship is quite as important as love and it isn't any easier than love.\n3520\n0\n3521\n0\n3522\n0\n3523\n0\n3524\n0\n3525\nMy sense about Greta is that people ought to wait and see and see if she doesn't indeed turn out to be as balanced as we hope and expect she will. But there you are.\n3526\nI think the first thing I thought when I got out to L.A. was just: Oh, if I want to act, I have to find a different way to go about it because the parts for girls are as dispiriting as the banking jobs. You have to really be willing to invent, I guess, a different path for yourself.\n3527\n0\n3528\nI've never really wanted to go to Japan, simply because I don't like eating fish and I know that's very popular out there in Africa.\n3529\n0\n3530\n0\n3531\n0\n3532\n0\n3533\n0\n3534\n0\n3535\n0\n3536\nI know from my own personal experience. I was bullied in middle school and high school and went through my fair share of hard times thereafter. Also, one of my really good friends committed suicide when I was in high school.\n3537\n0\n3538\n0\n3539\n0\n3540\n0\n3541\n0\n3542\n0\n3543\n0\n3544\n0\n3545\n0\n3546\n0\n3547\n0\n3548\n0\n3549\n0\n3550\n0\n3551\n0\n3552\n0\n3553\n0\n3554\nI only say this because a lot of people seem to think that if you're a musician you want to be a celebrity. But most musicians in the world aren't celebrities, and pretty much everything about the concept of 'celebrity' is a complete load of bollocks anyhow.\n3555\n0\n3556\n0\n3557\n0\n3558\nI'm so naive about finances. Once when my mother mentioned an amount and I realized I didn't understand, she had to explain: 'That's like three Mercedes.' Then I understood.\n3559\n0\n3560\n0\n3561\n0\n3562\n0\n3563\n0\n3564\n0\n3565\n0\n3566\n0\n3567\n0\n3568\n0\n3569\n0\n3570\nI think of Martin Luther King phrase a lot when I'm deciding public issues. He said: \"Here I stand: I can do no other.\" It is basically an affirmation of my ultimate responsibility to obey my conscience in my acts as a public official.\n3571\n0\n3572\n0\n3573\n0\n3574\n0\n3575\n0\n3576\n0\n3577\n0\n3578\n0\n3579\n0\n3580\n0\n3581\n0\n3582\nI see parody as another form of comedy. If you are making a comedy, there are a lot of different ways to do it. I'm not necessarily always aware of my quote-unquote persona when doing things like that. It's more, \"What does the character need at the time?\" I'm certainly drawn to certain types of material, there's no doubt about that.\n3583\nHere's Iraq, where irrigation was invented, where law was invented, where writing was invented. All these things that we consider necessities of civilization started there. And the people who live there damn well know that.\n3584\n0\n3585\n0\n3586\n0\n3587\n0\n3588\n0\n3589\n0\n3590\n0\n3591\n0\n3592\nI was so naive about writing, I went to the public library and checked out the only volume they had on the topic - an academic treatise about publishing from the WWII era.\n3593\n0\n3594\n0\n3595\n0\n3596\n0\n3597\n0\n3598\n0\n3599\n0\n3600\n0\n3601\n0\n3602\n0\n3603\n0\n3604\nYou are personally responsible for everything in your life, once you become aware that you are personally responsible for everything in your life.\n3605\n0\n3606\n0\n3607\n0\n3608\n0\n3609\n0\n3610\n0\n3611\n0\n3612\n0\n3613\n0\n3614\n0\n3615\n0\n3616\n0\n3617\n0\n3618\n0\n3619\n0\n3620\n0\n3621\n0\n3622\n0\n3623\n0\n3624\n0\n3625\nI get the feeling that sometimes the ideas work very well when you're doing them in the studio alone.\n3626\n0\n3627\n0\n3628\n0\n3629\n0\n3630\n0\n3631\n0\n3632\n0\n3633\n0\n3634\n0\n3635\n0\n3636\nFor one kiss, darling, I swear everything I would give. Cause you're a walking, talking reason to live.\n3637\nLas Vegas is a major family destination. Nevada casinos have become American family values now. It's considered just fine to go into one of these windowless scary gambling-malls, drink yourself silly, lose your ass at roulette, and then go ogle showgirls with breast implants. Republicans do this now. Working-class folks do it in polyester stretch pants. It's normal.\n3638\n0\n3639\n0\n3640\n0\n3641\n0\n3642\n0\n3643\n0\n3644\n0\n3645\nNegative, I am a meat popsicle.\n3646\n0\n3647\n0\n3648\n0\n3649\n0\n3650\n0\n3651\n0\n3652\n0\n3653\nMy dream was to not get a day job but to sleep, wake up and do my music. I want to keep that dream forever.\n3654\n0\n3655\n0\n3656\nI love reading. I'm very much into history, novels, biographies and I have a wide range of thrillers.\n3657\n0\n3658\nA songwriter writes songs all the time, whereas just writing a song can be done by anyone, anytime.\n3659\n0\n3660\n0\n3661\n0\n3662\n0\n3663\n0\n3664\n0\n3665\n0\n3666\n0\n3667\n0\n3668\n0\n3669\n0\n3670\n0\n3671\nYou need to tell the truth to the audience, or they will throw a brick through the TV. They'll turn you off.\n3672\n0\n3673\n0\n3674\nI will be putting out a fragrance - I'm following in the great steps of Puff Daddy.\n3675\nHannibal is very much a secular story, even though we dance right up to the supernatural a few times in the show, and, arguably, you could say we dipped our toe in an instance or two.\n3676\n0\n3677\n0\n3678\nThese shoes are Mr Silly's shoes, Scott.\n3679\n0\n3680\n0\n3681\n0\n3682\n0\n3683\n0\n3684\nWe don't need police officers who see themselves as warriors. We need police officers who see themselves as guardians and parts of the community. You can't police a community that you're not a part of.\n3685\n0\n3686\n0\n3687\n0\n3688\n0\n3689\n0\n3690\n0\n3691\nYou will be blessed the moment you realize you already are.\n3692\n0\n3693\nWhat it's done for me is highlight the fact that we need to lean into the cartoon universe of social media.\n3694\n0\n3695\n0\n3696\n0\n3697\n0\n3698\n0\n3699\nI'm a golfer not a history major.\n3700\n0\n3701\nSolutions to problems often come from knowing when to ask for help.\n3702\n0\n3703\n0\n3704\n0\n3705\n0\n3706\n0\n3707\n0\n3708\n0\n3709\n0\n3710\n0\n3711\n0\n3712\n0\n3713\n0\n3714\nI didn't look up and say, \"Oh, man, if I learn how to play a guitar I could make not much money, but I'd make a decent living like Eric Clapton or somebody.\" There wasn't nothing like that out there.\n3715\n0\n3716\n0\n3717\n0\n3718\n0\n3719\nHe's a Catholic, a Hindy, an atheist, a Chein, a Buddhist, a Baptist and a Jew, and he knows, he shouldn't kill.\n3720\n0\n3721\nThe idea of watching an entire film basically from one person's perspective - and not even really from their perspective, but [it's] probably the most intimately shot film that's in any of these categories. If you're not familiar with Son of Saul, basically it's a film about a Jewish guy who's in concentration camp, but he helps dispose of the bodies after they leave the gas chamber. So, you watch the entire movie looking at Saul's face and looking at his interactions with people.\n3722\n0\n3723\n0\n3724\n0\n3725\n0\n3726\n0\n3727\n0\n3728\n0\n3729\n0\n3730\nWe got Sally Field onboard [in Smokey and the Bandit] and it changed the entire dynamic. About a third of the way into filming, I was in the car with Sally and there was this little moment where we kind of looked at each other, and then we both turned and looked over at Hal [Needham]. He gave us a thumbs up and said, \"Yeah!\" And we kind of knew there was some magic going on.\n3731\nWe didn't have practical model rockets in the '50s. The ones we made were very dangerous and the kids that played with them didn't have all their fingers, and sometimes were blind in one eye.\n3732\n0\n3733\n0\n3734\n0\n3735\n0\n3736\n0\n3737\n0\n3738\nI want you to see that I'm looking. Look at me look at you. I'm cool with that.\n3739\n0\n3740\nAlso, this is what a pregnant Busy Philipps does in her free time, I'm taking master fondant cake decorating class with Anna from 'Ace of Cakes' at Duff's Charm City Cakes. It's, like, 4 three-hour classes.\n3741\n0\n3742\n0\n3743\n0\n3744\n0\n3745\n0\n3746\n0\n3747\n0\n3748\nA mind concerned about danger is a clouded mind. It's paralyzing.\n3749\nIf you leave your wife and you don't ever contact her again, that says something about how you felt about the marriage.\n3750\n0\n3751\n0\n3752\n0\n3753\n0\n3754\nThe world is nothing but my perception of it. I see only through myself.

A girl has a right to dance how she wants, when her favourite record comes on.\n3784\n0\n3785\n0\n3786\n0\n3787\n0\n3788\nI was just doing it for fun. I was in college recording music as a joke, so I really didn't think that a career was feasible - being able to travel.\n3789\nDifferent styles work for different guys... If you can handle shortstop and hit, teams will find a way to pencil you into the lineup.\n3790\n0\n3791\n0\n3792\n0\n3793\n0\n3794\n0\n3795\n0\n3796\n0\n3797\nI originally envisioned myself doing something with the suffix 'ology' at the end of it, like marine biology or entomology. But after I started to do some acting gigs, I thought it wasn't a bad thing... I said to myself, 'I might as well keep riding this bus until the wheels fall off.\n3798\nWe have a lot of women on the staff, obviously. It's a predominantly female writing staff and we hire the best people. It's not like we go we need more women or we need four women directing.\n3799\n0\n3800\n0\n3801\n0\n3802\n0\n3803\n0\n3804\n0\n3805\n0\n3806\n0\n3807\n0\n3808\n0\n3809\nWhen someone reaches middle age, people he knows begin to get put in charge of things, and knowing what he knows about the people who are being put in charge of things scares the hell out of him.\n3810\n0\n3811\n0\n3812\nI don't ever want to seem like I'm trying to command attention through the way I dress - but I have certainly been known to wear everything from a flamboyant suit to something very mellow and classic.\n3813\n0\n3814\n0\n3815\nHey, I don't have all the answers. In life, to be honest, I failed as much as I have succeeded. But I love my wife. I love my life. And I wish you my kind of success.\n3816\nYou shouldn't hate another women because she is beautiful and you shouldn't hate yourself because another women is beautiful. Like, that's the trap that women fall into so much and they are like ”She is so beautiful I hate her”. I could never say something like that about another women. I celebrate everyone's beauty. Celebrate their beauty and celebrate your own, find the beauty in yourself.\n3817\n0\n3818\n0\n3819\n0\n3820\nI traveled to Berlin promoting something a few years back, and Berlin is absolutely my favorite city I've ever been to.

I don't believe in dramatic statements when it comes to political critique. It doesn't communicate in a way that's subversive enough.\n3836\nMale aggression and lust are the energizing factors in culture. They are men's tools of survival in the pagan vastness of female nature.\n3837\n0\n3838\n0\n3839\n0\n3840\n0\n3841\n0\n3842\n0\n3843\n0\n3844\n0\n3845\nThe cool thing about my profession is that I can do it until the day I die.\n3846\n0\n3847\n0\n3848\n0\n3849\n0\n3850\n0\n3851\n0\n3852\n0\n3853\n0\n3854\n0\n3855\n0\n3856\n0\n3857\n0\n3858\n0\n3859\n0\n3860\n0\n3861\n0\n3862\n0\n3863\n0\n3864\n0\n3865\n0\n3866\nMy way of relaxing was always doing the opposite and playing the drums, but I need to be able to actually chill.\n3867\n0\n3868\n0\n3869\n0\n3870\n0\n3871\nOne of the things I love about the theater is that no one can tell you to stop. Once you're onstage, it's three hours, and whether you're completely off or you're just horrendous, you've got to find a way to leave an impression. There's not that terrible thing that you get when you're making a movie, where you get in your car at the end of the day knowing that something you're not proud of was immortalized on film, and you can't fix it because they won't reshoot it.\n3872\n0\n3873\n0\n3874\n0\n3875\nThere are certain models who might not be considered beautiful. I think personality is more important than looks.\n3876\n0\n3877\nMatter as matter rather than matter as symbol is a conscious political position, essentially Marxist.\n3878\n0\n3879\n0\n3880\n0\n3881\n0\n3882\n0\n3883\n0\n3884\nThere had always been black people in and out of our house, and from the outset I had been taught that for them life was defined by struggle and filled with injustice.\n3885\n0\n3886\n0\n3887\n0\n3888\n0\n3889\n0\n3890\n0\n3891\n0\n3892\n0\n3893\n0\n3894\n0\n3895\n0\n3896\n0\n3897\n0\n3898\nY'see, I get so bored so easily. I like to start with a clean slate each time. Sure, I'll have characters drop in and out of books but the main cast of characters always changes. Maybe I'm wrong but I think if had the same joe detective guy or gal, I wouldn't write them as well; I wouldn't do as good a job.\n3899\n0\n3900\n0\n3901\n0\n3902\n0\n3903\n0\n3904\n0\n3905\n0\n3906\n0\n3907\n0\n3908\n0\n3909\n0\n3910\n0\n3911\n0\n3912\nI love tweeting. I tweet every day. I stay in contact, I tell them what I'm doing. I've posted pictures of my books on there and they buy the books. It's a very good way to communicate with people, but I can't go to bed without tweeting something. I have to tweet something.\n3913\n0\n3914\n0\n3915\n0\n3916\n0\n3917\nIt used to be thought that only a certain kind of virus could get into our genome and it's called a retrovirus and that's a virus that might be HIV for example.\n3918\n0\n3919\n0\n3920\nI can no longer seduce because I love my husband. I don’t want to hurt him. I am no longer a man-eater.\n3921\nI kind of knew it wasn't going to be until my 30s that I really hit my stride as an actor.\n3922\n0\n3923\n0\n3924\n0\n3925\n0\n3926\n0\n3927\n0\n3928\n0\n3929\n0\n3930\n0\n3931\n0\n3932\n0\n3933\n0\n3934\n0\n3935\n0\n3936\n0\n3937\n0\n3938\n0\n3939\n0\n3940\n0\n3941\n0\n3942\n0\n3943\n0\n3944\n0\n3945\n0\n3946\n0\n3947\n0\n3948\n0\n3949\n0\n3950\n0\n3951\n0\n3952\n0\n3953\n0\n3954\n0\n3955\nWe dropped two bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and the name of the plane that delivered the weapons was the Enola Gay.

Intriguing in that it could be something interesting.

It's rare that the kids know nothing at all, and the somethings they do know are often only partially right or flat-out wrong.\n4061\n0\n4062\n0\n4063\nThe reports that Media Matters have done about sexism in our society and really the mainstream media called Hillary Clinton \"castrating,\" they called her the B word, they called her all kinds of horrible things.

I can't fix a car, sew, knit, cook, etc. Statistically, there is more I don't do than do.\n4077\n0\n4078\n0\n4079\n0\n4080\n0\n4081\n0\n4082\n0\n4083\n0\n4084\n0\n4085\n0\n4086\n0\n4087\nMy cell phone is my best friend.

The pressure is sort of off. It's like it's so under the radar in a sense that you can cast whoever you want.\n4109\n0\n4110\nMy major intention for coming to Hollywood - besides the fact that I was just enamored with acting from a very young age - was that I was tired of seeing wimpy Asian actors.\n4111\n0\n4112\n0\n4113\n0\n4114\n0\n4115\nI am in the process of starting a nonprofit organization that gives rescued animals a home in a simulated wild environment and, for those who have been tested on, who are disabled, aggressive, etc., their own space to live out their days.\n4116\n0\n4117\n0\n4118\n0\n4119\nI'm definitely curious about what the new iPhone and it's video editing capabilities will lend to that.\n4120\n0\n4121\n0\n4122\n0\n4123\n0\n4124\n0\n4125\n0\n4126\n0\n4127\n0\n4128\nI don't need to control anything. Even with romantic partnerships, I don't need to control anyone.\n4129\nThe idea that Taylor Swift would become the giant pop icon of 2015, 2016 - she's really good, but I don't think it's written in the stars.\n4130\nOur hearts, they need a mirror, Tessa. We see our better selves in the eyes of those who love us.\n4131\nWhen I was Elvira, it was probably the phase of my hair getting too high. I thought that if really high hair was good, then really higher hair was even better. So I just started having my hair get higher and higher. In some of the pictures, we had to cut off the picture because it was like Marge Simpson. So that was embarrassing. The wig phase.\n4132\n0\n4133\n0\n4134\n0\n4135\n0\n4136\n0\n4137\n0\n4138\n0\n4139\n0\n4140\n0\n4141\n0\n4142\nJewellery is a great way to take your look from day to night.\n4143\n0\n4144\n0\n4145\nMusic satisfies and nourishes the hunger within ourselves for connection and harmony.\n4146\n0\n4147\nOnscreen, babies and animals are my inspiration. They're so alive and there and not messed up in the head the way I am.\n4148\n0\n4149\n0\n4150\n0\n4151\n0\n4152\n0\n4153\n0\n4154\n0\n4155\n0\n4156\n0\n4157\nCreating my own roles, as an actor, is great. You're so at the mercy of other people, and you're waiting for a job. That's just a horrible way to live, so I just decided to take matters into my own hands, find my own projects, and create them myself, and then do other stuff that people might throw my way as well.\n4158\n0\n4159\n0\n4160\nThere is an interview given by [ Jean-Paul] Sartre in the USA where he is asked what the future of French literature is, and he replies that the next great writer of the future is [Albert] Camus.\n4161\n0\n4162\n0\n4163\n0\n4164\n0\n4165\nPeople expect a lot more from someone they think looks interesting. It's a burden.\n4166\n0\n4167\n0\n4168\n0\n4169\n0\n4170\n0\n4171\nYou actually do confront your dark side, your impulses, or your feelings of sibling rivalry in Cinderella or whatever. You admit that they exist and then you work through them and conquer them and come out living happily ever after having learned something. That's one reason why the fairy tales keep having traction and meaning.\n4172\n0\n4173\n0\n4174\n0\n4175\n0\n4176\n0\n4177\n0\n4178\n0\n4179\n0\n4180\n0\n4181\nI'm pretty much a good Catholic girl at heart and I believe in family. I also have a basic belief that God takes care of me. I believe in prayer, even though I'm not that religious. I just have that foundation from my family. I mean when you think that you're just a human being and one of God's creatures, you can't take anything that seriously.\n4182\n0\n4183\n0\n4184\n0\n4185\n0\n4186\nI used to go around looking as frumpy as possible because it was inconceivable you could be attractive as well as be smart. It wasn't until I started being myself, the way I like to turn out to meet people that I started to get any work.\n4187\n0\n4188\n0\n4189\n0\n4190\n0\n4191\n0\n4192\n0\n4193\n0\n4194\n0\n4195\n0\n4196\n0\n4197\n0\n4198\n0\n4199\n0\n4200\n0\n4201\n0\n4202\n0\n4203\n0\n4204\n0\n4205\n0\n4206\n0\n4207\n0\n4208\n0\n4209\n0\n4210\n0\n4211\n0\n4212\n0\n4213\n0\n4214\n0\n4215\n0\n4216\n0\n4217\n0\n4218\n0\n4219\n0\n4220\n0\n4221\n0\n4222\n0\n4223\n0\n4224\n0\n4225\n0\n4226\n0\n4227\n0\n4228\n0\n4229\n0\n4230\n0\n4231\nWell, I've cleaned bathrooms in a warehouse. That was pretty terrible.

It's got the desert, the mountains, and the ocean. It's beautiful.\n4269\n0\n4270\n0\n4271\n0\n4272\nEven if I thought I could get a submission I'm not laying underneath a grown man with my legs spread on worldwide TV. Some guys subscribe to that theory but I am a Republican and we don't do that.\n4273\n0\n4274\n0\n4275\nI was born and raised in the University of Chicago area and had an uneventful middle-class Catholic childhood. I had a heavy Catholic upbringing and Catholicism is terrible - it's the reason there were slaves. Mass every morning at seven o'clock during Lent. It's a totally negative, man-made religion.\n4276\n0\n4277\n0\n4278\nThe visual is everywhere in the streets, but in the industry, it's like you have to show up at this party and you can't take on the world in one day. It's a gradual process, but you can't let it frustrate you; you just have to keep grinding.\n4279\n0\n4280\n0\n4281\n0\n4282\n0\n4283\n0\n4284\nI've never met Eminem; you don't meet Eminem.

And I spoke to relatives. A lot of wonderful photographs were made available to me from that period - 1950-1956 - and those were given to me by a Korean newspaper in Seoul. Ruined villages, refugees streaming through a river valley, GI's and orphans and orphanages, those tiny details that you can only see in a picture.\n4292\nFor a time, it would work well. then it worked less and my pain was more. I would go through wild bouts of depression, horrible comedowns. I understand why kids kill themselves. I absolutely do. You feel terrible. You feel soul-less. \"I'll never do it to my child\".\n4293\n0\n4294\n0\n4295\n0\n4296\n0\n4297\n0\n4298\n0\n4299\nMost of the time I meet my trainer at the gym and we do a lot of everything: weights circuit with cardio, football drills, sprinting with weights on the treadmill.\n4300\n0\n4301\n0\n4302\n0\n4303\n0\n4304\n0\n4305\n0\n4306\n0\n4307\n0\n4308\n0\n4309\n0\n4310\nPoor people cannot rely on the government to come to help you in times of need. You have to get your education. Then nobody can control your destiny.\n4311\n0\n4312\n0\n4313\n0\n4314\n0\n4315\nWhen you break the heart of the philosopher, you must apply great force and cunning strategy, but when the deed is completed, the heart lies in great stony ruin at your feet. If you succeed in breaking it, the job is done once and for all. It will not be repaired.\n4316\n0\n4317\n0\n4318\n0\n4319\n0\n4320\n0\n4321\n0\n4322\n0\n4323\n0\n4324\n0\n4325\n0\n4326\n0\n4327\n0\n4328\n0\n4329\nBecause [writers] Dan Weiss and David Benioff have done such a great job in adapting them, that's what we work with. It serves no purpose to anybody for actors to come onto a set with a well-thumbed copy of the source material and start querying why this or that line has been left out of the script. It's probably been left out for a good reason.\n4330\n0\n4331\nI've always been aware of the otherworld, of spirits that exist in that twilight place that lies in the corner of our eyes, of fairie and stranger things still that we spy only when we're not really paying attention to them, whispers and flickering shadows, here one moment, gone the instant we turn our heads for a closer look. But I couldn't always find them. And when I did, for a long time I thought they were only this excess of imagination that I carry around inside me, that somehow it was leaking out of me into the world.\n4332\n0\n4333\n0\n4334\n0\n4335\n0\n4336\n0\n4337\n0\n4338\n0\n4339\n0\n4340\n0\n4341\n0\n4342\n0\n4343\n0\n4344\n0\n4345\n0\n4346\n0\n4347\n0\n4348\n0\n4349\n0\n4350\n0\n4351\n0\n4352\n0\n4353\n0\n4354\n0\n4355\n0\n4356\n0\n4357\n0\n4358\n0\n4359\n0\n4360\n0\n4361\n0\n4362\n0\n4363\n0\n4364\n0\n4365\nI try to hire people who will challenge and have the humility to be challenged - people who have basically good values.\n4366\nGreat leaders are willing to retire unloved and unpopular as the price for great exertion.\n4367\n0\n4368\n0\n4369\nI'm trying to illuminate how perilously narrow we draw the concepts of masculinity and sexuality in our male culture.\n4370\n0\n4371\n0\n4372\n0\n4373\n0\n4374\n0\n4375\n0\n4376\n0\n4377\n0\n4378\n0\n4379\n0\n4380\n0\n4381\n0\n4382\n0\n4383\n0\n4384\n0\n4385\n0\n4386\n0\n4387\n0\n4388\n0\n4389\n0\n4390\n0\n4391\n0\n4392\n0\n4393\n0\n4394\n0\n4395\n0\n4396\nPalestinians don't really believe in a state of Israel. They, unlike a majority of Israelis, who have come to the conclusion that they can live with a two-state solution to be determined by the parties, the majority of Palestinians are still very reluctant, and they need to be pushed to get there.\n4397\n0\n4398\n0\n4399\n0\n4400\n0\n4401\n0\n4402\n0\n4403\n0\n4404\n0\n4405\nI wrote two million words of crap.

It's such a touchy subject. You can attack any other religion and nothing bad will come about.\n4424\n0\n4425\n0\n4426\nIn summary, our world is doomed.\n4427\n0\n4428\n0\n4429\n0\n4430\n0\n4431\n0\n4432\n0\n4433\nMake sure to be honest with yourself, about if that's really what you want to do with your life - to make music. It takes a commitment - a tremendous, thick-skinned commitment of being the first one to get there and the last one to leave, doing what you want to do even if you have to work twice as hard as anybody else ever did.\n4434\n0\n4435\nI am a Patsy Cline fan.\n4436\n0\n4437\n0\n4438\n0\n4439\n0\n4440\n0\n4441\n0\n4442\nBeing at the mercy of the acting profession, in the early days of one's career, is really brutal and feels like you have no control over your life, at all.\n4443\n0\n4444\nDo not simplify. Do not worry about failure. Failure is a badge of honour.

Then, when I'm tired of writing, I'll go work on my music. When I'm sick of music, I'll be like, I'm going to start performing comedy now. So it's good. It's not like I want to be famous or anything.\n4492\n0\n4493\n0\n4494\n0\n4495\n0\n4496\n0\n4497\n0\n4498\n0\n4499\n0\n4500\n0\n4501\nI'm a little bit scared of re-recording.\n4502\n0\n4503\n0\n4504\nYou can always tell when something is good, because the studio senses it has something good, and you can see them pour more and more resources into it. The promotion gets bigger and bigger.\n4505\n0\n4506\n0\n4507\n0\n4508\nI was working full time and going to school at night and on the weekends. It was just crazy. At one point a month had gone by, and Marc - my then boyfriend, now husband, and I hadn't gone out on a date. I was like, I don't want to be this person. I want to be a person who cares where she's investing her time and energy. And I want to be a good wife, daughter, and friend.\n4509\nFirst of all, who cares if people hate you? There's always a guarantee that certain people will dislike you. There's never any guarantee that anyone will like you. So if anyone likes you at all, you've already won.\n4510\n0\n4511\n0\n4512\nIf an organization produces a document, it should be made public as soon as possible.\n4513\nI have hundreds of Word documents filled with pages of one-liners.

It just gives you an insight on what's coming up next and finding out about new artists.\n4527\n0\n4528\n0\n4529\n0\n4530\n0\n4531\n0\n4532\n0\n4533\n0\n4534\n0\n4535\n0\n4536\n0\n4537\n0\n4538\n0\n4539\n0\n4540\n0\n4541\n0\n4542\n0\n4543\n0\n4544\n0\n4545\n0\n4546\n0\n4547\n0\n4548\n0\n4549\nIf, as a culture, we don’t bear witness to grief, the burden of loss is placed entirely upon the bereaved, while the rest of us avert our eyes and wait for those in mourning to stop being sad, to let go, to move on, to cheer up. And if they don’t — if they have loved too deeply, if they do wake each morning thinking, I cannot continue to live — well, then we pathologize their pain; we call their suffering a disease. We do not help them: we tell them that they need to get help.\n4550\n0\n4551\n0\n4552\n0\n4553\n0\n4554\nAs far as women who are being abused by pimps, I think if you see women who do incalls or outcalls rather than work on the street, they are less likely - from what I've heard - to have pimps.

I'm very fond of certain pastas and sauces that I can just about cook from scratch. So those are what I like to cook, as well as roasted potatoes and chicken. Anything that tastes alright.\n4600\n0\n4601\nI just got my phone back yesterday. My mom had it for two days. I was supposed to read a book and I really wanted to play Call Of Duty.\n4602\n0\n4603\n0\n4604\n0\n4605\n0\n4606\nThe umlaut isn't on my birth certificate. I had this book as a child called Chloe and Maude, and there was an umlaut on the e, and I said, I want that! It's a little flair. Just to confuse people even more.\n4607\n0\n4608\n0\n4609\n0\n4610\n0\n4611\n0\n4612\n0\n4613\n0\n4614\n0\n4615\n0\n4616\n0\n4617\n0\n4618\n0\n4619\n0\n4620\nAll power within the microcosm of my world was held and wielded by people who look like me. Plus, I think Nigerians all have this sense that they are better than everyone, including white people. So I have the privilege of a certain distance. It may just be that. So in a sense, I can't claim that as any ability that I have, simply a matter of circumstance.\n4621\n0\n4622\n0\n4623\n0\n4624\nThe plant goes down. The industry is weaker. The price of the commodity has lagged. Any of those things can push people into unemployment or lower income categories, and that hurts.\n4625\nI had some very fit people. I worked with a lot of athletes helping them, especially combat athletes, MMA fighters,[Dennis] Bermudez, [Chris] Weidman, and guys on the lower levels - boxers and MMA fighters.\n4626\n0\n4627\n0\n4628\n0\n4629\n0\n4630\nWhen you're a music director, you have people constantly sending you music and trying to get - I mean, I'm sure you have the exact same thing when you do a magazine - that you have people constantly wanting to get your attention. And I think I learnt a lot from being on that end of things, when I was trying to book the tour, the first tour we did.\n4631\n0\n4632\n0\n4633\n0\n4634\n0\n4635\n0\n4636\n0\n4637\n0\n4638\n0\n4639\n0\n4640\n0\n4641\nIt's a luxury to play. I get to play basketball for a living. I'm a lucky guy and I'm thankful for everything I have and what I get to do. I realize how many people would give their left foot to just play one game in the NBA. This is the NBA!\n4642\n0\n4643\n0\n4644\n0\n4645\n0\n4646\n0\n4647\nGirls are losing their virginity at 15, 16. I'm not promoting that. But my songs are talking... about me becoming a man.\n4648\n0\n4649\n0\n4650\n0\n4651\n0\n4652\n0\n4653\n0\n4654\n0\n4655\n0\n4656\n0\n4657\n0\n4658\n0\n4659\n0\n4660\n0\n4661\n0\n4662\nWe have to put America's security first. The American people - we on this stage need to open our ears. We need to open our ears. The American people are not whispering to us. They are screaming to us. And they're screaming to us that it's our job to actually make this government work.It's so dysfunctional under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. It's so ineffective. It's so ineffectual that the American people say, we don't trust them to do anything anymore. So I'm not going to let Syrian refugees, any Syrian refugees in this country.\n4663\n0\n4664\n0\n4665\n0\n4666\n0\n4667\nI’m not really afraid to be my awkward self, and I know there’s lots and lots of other people just like me out there that are awkward themselves. And I think they just appreciate that I’m not afraid to say the weird things that I say and tweet the obnoxious things that I tweet. But I’ve tried being other people and myself suits me the best. I think you just be honest. I think people respond to honesty.\n4668\n0\n4669\n0\n4670\n0\n4671\n0\n4672\n0\n4673\n0\n4674\n0\n4675\n0\n4676\n0\n4677\n0\n4678\n0\n4679\n0\n4680\n0\n4681\n0\n4682\n0\n4683\n0\n4684\n0\n4685\n0\n4686\n0\n4687\n0\n4688\n0\n4689\n0\n4690\n0\n4691\n0\n4692\n0\n4693\nBeing comedian outside of performing, you're someone who's analyzing life, and thinking about it, and observing so much. In my opinion, it can make you feel sort of on the outside looking in.\n4694\n0\n4695\nThe cool things about space is when you put your pants on here, you can put them on two legs at a time.\n4696\n0\n4697\nIf you can build your career around your passions, then you're winning in life; that's one of the best things you can ask for.\n4698\n0\n4699\n0\n4700\n0\n4701\nThe NYPD with the unconditional support of Mayor Michael Bloomberg has stopped-and-frisked more black men than there are black men in New York City. Institutionalized racial discrimination in the United States is alive and well.\n4702\nHuman beings can be redeemed. Empires cannot. Our refusal to face the truth about empire, our refusal to defy the multitudinous crimes and atrocities of empire, has brought about the nightmare Malcolm predicted. And as the Digital Age and our post-literate society implant a terrifying historical amnesia, these crimes are erased as swiftly as they are committed.\n4703\n0\n4704\n0\n4705\nBeing a father is certainly a task. But the best one that I could ever ask for. Being home, being with the family, that's what it's about...\n4706\n0\n4707\n0\n4708\n0\n4709\n0\n4710\n0\n4711\n0\n4712\n0\n4713\n0\n4714\n0\n4715\nI was on significant financial aid, an only child, with parents who didn't have much living in North Carolina.\n4716\n0\n4717\nI think I've had the slowest, most methodical career in the business.\n4718\nWhen you stop being nervous is when you should retire. I'm always a little nervous for anything I do because when complacency sets in, that's when I feel it's time to move on to something else.\n4719\n0\n4720\n0\n4721\n0\n4722\n0\n4723\n0\n4724\n0\n4725\n0\n4726\n0\n4727\n0\n4728\n0\n4729\n0\n4730\n0\n4731\n0\n4732\n0\n4733\nWhen I was in school, I was always writing scripts and dressing up as characters. I'd constantly be that guy who'd get up on stage. I used to write imaginary TV shows, like soap operas, for fun.\n4734\n0\n4735\n0\n4736\n0\n4737\n0\n4738\n0\n4739\nThere's this idea that artists are free and that means that we can do whatever we want to do. And it's very important to engage with this idea, just as human beings, that we are free to do what we wanna do. So the real question becomes, then, what do we wanna do? And as one gets to know oneself, one finds that there are things that return again and again that you wanna do.\n4740\n0\n4741\nI tell my staff, we're riding a tour bus around, and we're going to stop and look at some weird stuff - but we're taking our viewers around safely. They're just looking out the window at it. I'm trying to create a sense of comfort for my center audience.\n4742\n0\n4743\n0\n4744\n0\n4745\n0\n4746\nWell, it's always strange to kiss someone with 10, 20, 40 people around.\n4747\n0\n4748\n0\n4749\n0\n4750\n0\n4751\n0\n4752\nNo one ever takes my side.\n4753\n0\n4754\nThe cauliflower soup sounds so good. And the broccoli-melt sandwich. I've never heard of such a thing.\n4755\n0\n4756\n0\n4757\n0\n4758\n0\n4759\n0\n4760\n0\n4761\nThere is a sort of exotic preposterousness about a lot of elections, the way arguments are made even cruder.\n4762\nI love Polo. I have a lot of Ralph Lauren suits. I got Dolce, I got a little bit of everything. And my favorite thing about Ralph Lauren is that he puts the number three on a lot of his clothes, so I feel like it's meant for me.\n4763\nIt feels great to not be the acne-ridden outsider that I felt like when I was in high school. It's a lot more fun being alive now than it was then, I'll say that much.\n4764\n0\n4765\n0\n4766\nThe challenge is not finding the attitude, but it's really just being open and willing to go for it and try different things, and having a director that you can trust. The attitude is not something that I intended or created.\n4767\n0\n4768\n0\n4769\n0\n4770\n0\n4771\n0\n4772\n0\n4773\n0\n4774\n0\n4775\n0\n4776\nOnly a woman can make you feel wrong for doing something right.\n4777\n0\n4778\n0\n4779\n0\n4780\n0\n4781\nI really learned to approach climbing not just with a pure athletic mentality, but also to appreciate all these beautiful places we get to go to.\n4782\n0\n4783\n0\n4784\n0\n4785\n0\n4786\n0\n4787\n0\n4788\n0\n4789\n0\n4790\n0\n4791\n0\n4792\n0\n4793\n0\n4794\nI absolutely love everything about Christmas music.\n4795\nI think real life reflects your movies. In your life, you pick stuff that influences what movie roles you wanna pick. I think if you've got an interesting life, you wanna do interesting movies about interesting things.\n4796\n0\n4797\n0\n4798\n0\n4799\n0\n4800\n0\n4801\nStorytelling is one of comics' esthetic hurdles at the moment, which was the novelist's problem 150 years ago: namely, to take comics from storytelling into that of \"writing,\" the major distinction between the two to me being that the former gives one the facts, but the latter tries to recreate the sensation and complexities of life within the fluidity of consciousness and experience. As far as I'm concerned, that's really all I've been trying to do formally for the past decade or more with comics, and it's certainly time-consuming, since it has to be done with drawings, not words.\n4802\n0\n4803\n0\n4804\n0\n4805\n0\n4806\n0\n4807\n0\n4808\n0\n4809\n0\n4810\n0\n4811\nI like trendy clothes just like everybody else does.\n4812\n0\n4813\nThe Clash were innovative, radical and helped drive a change in music that was ground-breaking. In comparison to some of the music today they sounded like they meant it. I still listen to their music today to remind myself what music made with commitment sounds like.\n4814\n0\n4815\n0\n4816\nI have to have breakfast and breakfast has to be eggs, whether in omelet form, hard-boiled, or over-easy.\n4817\n0\n4818\n0\n4819\n0\n4820\n0\n4821\n0\n4822\nArt is something to be proud of. Art is no compromise. As an actor, you're giving it up, you're at the mercy of so many other people.\n4823\n0\n4824\n0\n4825\n0\n4826\n0\n4827\n0\n4828\n0\n4829\n0\n4830\n0\n4831\n0\n4832\n0\n4833\nIt's my genius plan of avoiding any career momentum whatsoever. Definitely the pop-culture thing is something I've avoided in my act. It's just too transitory and ephemeral.\n4834\n0\n4835\n0\n4836\nBack in the day however, careers were strictly built on competitions, just like surfing, though surfing is changing too so you can free surf and still get paid. So I think that rivalry was really because of the fans and the media who built it up, but it did bring something exciting about the sport, just like in any sport, whether it's Larry Bird or Magic Johnson, I think it just made skating that much more exciting.\n4837\n0\n4838\n0\n4839\n0\n4840\n0\n4841\n0\n4842\nA shoe is not only a design, but it's a part of your body language, the way you walk. The way you're going to move is quite dictated by your shoes.\n4843\n0\n4844\n0\n4845\n0\n4846\n0\n4847\n0\n4848\n0\n4849\n0\n4850\n0\n4851\nI Google everyone I meet and I look up designers.\n4852\nI want to do films I can relate to emotionally.\n4853\n0\n4854\nThe U.S. military is investing in new storage technology because most of the weight that soldiers carry on their backs is batteries. Once that gets developed for the military, it will be expanded to civilians.\n4855\nAnd then theres always the crying and the weeping that we hear-children, women, even men. And these images and these sounds are always with me.\n4856\n0\n4857\nThe secret to thriving is the knowledge that we are never simply victims of our bodies. It’s very reassuring to know that we all have within us the ability to heal from anything and go on to live joy-filled lives.\n4858\n0\n4859\n0\n4860\n0\n4861\n0\n4862\n0\n4863\nIt's important to recognize your own self-destructive behavior and be honest about it. You're only hurting yourself or losing out on your truth and happiness. I'm not afraid to face my own personal stuff. It's so important to dig it up and figure it out and move on.\n4864\nSometimes I stand there going, 'I'm not doing any of this right!' And then I get this big man belch out of her, and I go, 'Ah, we accomplished this together.'\n4865\n0\n4866\n0\n4867\nI have to admit, I do loooove eggnog.\n4868\n0\n4869\n0\n4870\nI was living in Maryland and my first week was dreadful. My first week I actually got into a fight at school\n4871\nIt felt very natural to me to write a Christmas song, but at the same time I had to really put all sorts of pressure aside and just let the creativity flow and see what came out.\n4872\nIt's so normal for a teenager to dress in black -- and be real unhappy and stay in your room and say sarcastic things. How could something so normal be considered morbid?\n4873\n0\n4874\nI wish I didn't have to live up to anything.\n4875\n0\n4876\n0\n4877\n0\n4878\n0\n4879\n0\n4880\n0\n4881\nOne of the things that's amazing about reading the private writing of these folks is that they enthusiastically describe things which we have now seen, and which are widely regarded as unappealing. They'll write, \"It's going to be beautiful, we're going to have a town of 1,000 stone buildings that are all identical.\" And we as modern readers think, we've seen that; that's bad Soviet architecture or a public housing project. Nobody fantasizes about living there.\n4882\n0\n4883\nI think I have a male side about me and you have a female side about you. It's a question of repressing or not.\n4884\n0\n4885\n0\n4886\n0\n4887\n0\n4888\n0\n4889\n0\n4890\nI’m not being weird, you’re being a little rude. Don’t you think as a host, when I say ‘this is what I want to talk about’ that’s what we should address?\n4891\n0\n4892\n0\n4893\n0\n4894\n0\n4895\n0\n4896\n0\n4897\n0\n4898\n0\n4899\n0\n4900\n0\n4901\nComedy is the result of what's happening, not what people are doing. Because if people are doing comedy. It's embarrassing. The individual elements have to be straight-faced, serious, realistic with a firm basis. What makes it comedy is a somewhat shifted way to put it together.\n4902\n0\n4903\n0\n4904\n0\n4905\n0\n4906\n0\n4907\n0\n4908\n0\n4909\n0\n4910\n0\n4911\n0\n4912\n0\n4913\nFor me, cultivation of my own style really started by looking at people. There are just some really beautiful people in the world. When you're walking down the street, or you're at a restaurant, someone catches your eye because they have their own look. It goes way beyond what they're wearing-into their mannerisms, the way they smile, or just the way they hold themselves.\n4914\n0\n4915\n0\n4916\n0\n4917\n0\n4918\n0\n4919\n0\n4920\n0\n4921\n0\n4922\nOver my 24 years in the Senate, Jim, I've never voted against anyone because of their substantive views.\n4923\n0\n4924\n0\n4925\n0\n4926\n0\n4927\n0\n4928\n0\n4929\n0\n4930\n0\n4931\n0\n4932\n0\n4933\n0\n4934\n0\n4935\n0\n4936\n0\n4937\n0\n4938\n0\n4939\n0\n4940\n0\n4941\n0\n4942\n0\n4943\n0\n4944\n0\n4945\n0\n4946\n0\n4947\nWhy did Ted Geisel end up writing and illustrating for young minds? He has specific imagery in the book, and we never would have moved beyond the discussion phase, if we couldn't have found an expression for The Lorax, dimensionally, that was true to the soul of what comes through in his simple line drawings, on the page.\n4948\n0\n4949\n[Donald] Trump won fair and square! He got 13.3 million votes. He won all over the country. He won when the race was crowded and when it was a one on one against Ted Cruz. There's just no reasonable way to keep Trump from the nomination while insisting that the will of the Republican voter is being respected.\n4950\n0\n4951\n0\n4952\nMy most enjoyable movie going experiences have always been going to a movie theater, sitting there and the lights go down and a film comes on the screen that you don't know everything about, and you don't know every plot turn and every character movement that's going to happen.\n4953\n0\n4954\n0\n4955\n0\n4956\n0\n4957\n0\n4958\n0\n4959\nNo sir, I don't know why, but my eyes don't cry no more.\n4960\n0\n4961\n0\n4962\n0\n4963\n0\n4964\nIf the movie is terrible you can have fun. You can joke about it and have a ball. The movie is already sort of established as a kind of extraordinary piece of work even though it hasn't opened yet to the public. It is harder because you can't go against it and you can't be interesting. You have to go with the flow. Although one is very happy to be in it, it is sort of hard to talk about it. It is hard to talk about successful. It is much easier to talk about failure.\n4965\n0\n4966\n0\n4967\nWhat's become more important to me over time is to not try to sell myself as someone that I'm not, and that begins with coming out of the closet and gradually it's a challenge to expand that into other areas of my life.\n4968\n0\n4969\n0\n4970\n0\n4971\n0\n4972\nIt's very bizarre though when you get hired and then the director will say, \"I know how this goes.\" And you're thinking, \"Wait a minute, I thought that I was doing this\" but basically what they really want, especially if they wrote it, is they want you to do it as they imagined it. It's virtually impossible.\n4973\n0\n4974\n0\n4975\n0\n4976\n0\n4977\n0\n4978\n0\n4979\n0\n4980\n0\n4981\n0\n4982\n0\n4983\n0\n4984\nThere's nothing that hasn't happened before, guys. In the '80s we were all doing the '60s. In the '90s, we were doing the '70s. There's not one way to wear jeans anymore though. Flared, skinny, ripped, high, low, whatever. It used to be that there was one cool jean. There was a while where it was stonewashed, god forbid.\n4985\n0\n4986\n0\n4987\n0\n4988\n0\n4989\n0\n4990\n0\n4991\n0\n4992\n0\n4993\n0\n4994\nLet the voice be the voice of the voiceless and let it come from the world of rap music to keep the stereotype and the peace at the same time.\n4995\n0\n4996\n0\n4997\n0\n4998\nIt wouldn't do me much good to back somebody that won in Iowa if they can't carry on the campaign elsewhere.\n4999\nForeign policy is all about a universe of bad decisions, imperfect decisions; every situation is different. The dynamics, the atmospherics, the people, the pressures, the geopolitical realities shift.\n5000\n0\n5001\n0\n5002\n0\n5003\nNo woman will ever satisfy me. I know that now, and I would never try to deny it. But this is actually okay, because I will never satisfy a woman, either. Should I be writing such thoughts? Perhaps not. Perhaps it’s a bad idea. I can definitely foresee a scenario where that first paragraph could come back to haunt me, especially if I somehow became marginally famous.\n5004\n0\n5005\n0\n5006\n0\n5007\n0\n5008\n0\n5009\n0\n5010\n0\n5011\n0\n5012\n0\n5013\n0\n5014\nKarate is the best thing you can do for your child.\n5015\n0\n5016\n0\n5017\nWhen you understand, that what you're telling is just a story. It isn't happening anymore. When you realize the story you're telling is just words, when you can just crumble up and throw your past in the trashcan, then we'll figure out who you're going to be.\n5018\n0\n5019\n0\n5020\n0\n5021\n0\n5022\n0\n5023\nFrom the Medicare prescription drug plan to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the passage of No Child Left Behind, President Bush presided over a major expansion of the reach of government.\n5024\n0\n5025\n0\n5026\nMost pilots learn, when they pin on their wings and go out and get in a fighter, especially, that one thing you don't do, you don't believe anything anybody tells you about an airplane.\n5027\n0\n5028\n0\n5029\n0\n5030\n0\n5031\n0\n5032\n0\n5033\n0\n5034\n0\n5035\n0\n5036\nMy wife can see always how a part affects me personally because she has to live with it.\n5037\n0\n5038\n0\n5039\n0\n5040\n0\n5041\n0\n5042\nHomeopathy offers a safe, natural alternative that causes no side effects or drug interactions.\n5043\n0\n5044\n0\n5045\nI've done over 125 posters and I have worked with some of the best photographers in the world.They made me America's Number one Pin Up.\n5046\n0\n5047\n0\n5048\n0\n5049\n0\n5050\n0\n5051\nOne reason I was interested in photography was to get away from the preciousness of the art object.\n5052\n0\n5053\n0\n5054\n0\n5055\n0\n5056\n0\n5057\n0\n5058\nMy work doesn't have the same rules as, say, Andy [Warhol]'s work. But it's gathered together for the simple reason that we all worked with the images and objects around us.\n5059\n0\n5060\n0\n5061\n0\n5062\nI am a feminist. And I'm so glad that Lena Dunham exists, because she is one too, and she's quite vocal about it. Yes, women have more freedom and more influence than ever, but it's hardly equal. It's just not.\n5063\n0\n5064\n0\n5065\n0\n5066\n0\n5067\n0\n5068\n0\n5069\nI'm the only United States Senator in the country that I'm aware of that's had the far left up on TV and the far right up on TV against me at the same time.\n5070\nIf you’re reading to find friends, you’re in deep trouble.\n5071\n0\n5072\n0\n5073\n0\n5074\n0\n5075\n0\n5076\n0\n5077\n0\n5078\n0\n5079\n0\n5080\n0\n5081\n0\n5082\n0\n5083\n0\n5084\n0\n5085\n0\n5086\n0\n5087\n0\n5088\n0\n5089\n0\n5090\n0\n5091\n0\n5092\n0\n5093\nThe Constitution does not vest in Congress the authority to protect society from every bad act that might befall it....[I]f followed to its logical extreme, [this approach] would result in an unwarranted expansion of federal power.\n5094\n0\n5095\n0\n5096\n0\n5097\n0\n5098\n0\n5099\n0\n5100\nWhen I got the episode where Spider-Man meets Aunt May (voiced by Misty Lee), it was another one of those things where I was like, \"I can't believe I have a scene with Aunt May. That's just amazing to me.\" And they drew her a lot younger and hotter then the Aunt May that I remember.\n5101\n0\n5102\n0\n5103\n0\n5104\n0\n5105\n0\n5106\n0\n5107\n0\n5108\n0\n5109\n0\n5110\n0\n5111\n0\n5112\n0\n5113\n0\n5114\nSisterhood is magical and medicinal - use it as a lifelong resource.\n5115\n0\n5116\n0\n5117\n0\n5118\n0\n5119\n0\n5120\n0\n5121\n0\n5122\n0\n5123\n0\n5124\n0\n5125\n0\n5126\n0\n5127\n0\n5128\n0\n5129\n0\n5130\n0\n5131\n0\n5132\n0\n5133\n0\n5134\n0\n5135\n0\n5136\n0\n5137\n0\n5138\n0\n5139\n0\n5140\nOne of the factors that make great companies so great is that they have processes that allow them to solve difficult problems again and again. These processes have developed over time as teams have successfully wrestled with a certain type of challenge. Eventually, people begin to say, \"This is just how we do something around here.\" The problem develops when that team then has to solve a very different set of challenges. The processes that are such strengths can be crushing liabilities.\n5141\n0\n5142\n0\n5143\n0\n5144\n0\n5145\n0\n5146\nTeachers didn't like me very much.

I realised when I was playing in bands that I wasn't that comfortable being on-stage, and I preferred to be behind-the-scenes.

This belch, when silently released, would cause people standing twenty yards away to start examining the soles of their shoes. The vocalized version sounded like a bag of tools thrown into a bog.\n5190\n0\n5191\nI can honestly say I've never chosen a film because where it's shot is convenient.\n5192\n0\n5193\n0\n5194\n0\n5195\n0\n5196\n0\n5197\n0\n5198\n0\n5199\n0\n5200\n0\n5201\n0\n5202\n0\n5203\n0\n5204\nWherever I am, I think it's my show.\n5205\n0\n5206\nPeople always feel like there's a big split between TV and films: I'm a television actress, I'm a film actress. Maybe that's how it was but I feel like there's not that separation anymore. And actors are able to kind of flow between both worlds - and connect to both audiences.\n5207\n0\n5208\n0\n5209\n0\n5210\n0\n5211\n0\n5212\n0\n5213\n0\n5214\nWhen you're in a room with a guy who has a vision like that, it's just one of those things where you close your eyes and just see that vision - then you just go with it. The guys that I write with are so incredible, just like my producer Trent Willmon, those guys know how to bring things out of me - especially things that I maybe didn't even know that I had.\n5215\n0\n5216\n0\n5217\n0\n5218\n0\n5219\n0\n5220\n0\n5221\n0\n5222\n0\n5223\nI usually end up falling for one of my really good guy friends because I know everything about them, and you fall in love with their personalities, and it makes them become attractive to you in your eyes.\n5224\n0\n5225\n0\n5226\n0\n5227\n0\n5228\n0\n5229\n0\n5230\n0\n5231\n0\n5232\n0\n5233\n0\n5234\n0\n5235\n0\n5236\n0\n5237\n0\n5238\nEvery week a tsunami rips through poor towns and villages all over the world. It claims 25,000 lives a day, 175,000 a week. It sweeps children from the arms of their mothers, robs hundreds of millions of any hope for the future. That tsunami is hunger. Help us end it now.\n5239\nAlmost every comedy you see is about people making all wrong choices and making all the errors of judgement possible. Good comedy is when it works on this scale. Because it is psychologically very real.\n5240\n0\n5241\n0\n5242\n0\n5243\nOccasionally I play the music for my mother when she demands to hear it and she always just says, 'Who is that singing? I don't like the singing.' And then she says 'Who's doing all that bumpety-bump noise?' It's all noise backing up horrible singing as far as she's concerned. She's not a show-biz mother.\n5244\nWhen I was younger it was, you know, my dad dressed up in drag on 'Bosom Buddies.' And that was what I was having to deal with at the time. And then around the time that I was into college was when he became statue-worthy I guess you could say.\n5245\nI just want to be a better guitar player, really.\n5246\n0\n5247\n0\n5248\nI've seen videos, I've seen circumstances where men and women that have been in the military have come back and been treated unjustly by the country they have fought for, and have been murdered by the country they fought for, on our land. That's not right.\n5249\n0\n5250\n0\n5251\n0\n5252\n0\n5253\n0\n5254\n0\n5255\nIt was a nice relief to be able to work on individual songs.\n5256\nOnstage I do all the stuff I'd never do in real life, like lashing out at people who make me mad or freaking out in a long bank lineup. Performing allows me to fulfill all the sicko fantasies I've ever had.\n5257\n0\n5258\n0\n5259\n0\n5260\n0\n5261\nDon't be buffaloed by experts and elites. Experts often possess more data than judgment. Elites can become so inbred that they produce hemophiliacs who bleed to death as soon as they are nicked by the real world.\n5262\nNew York Stat agreed to pay $12 million to settle a lawsuit filed three decades ago by inmates swept up in the bloody 1971 revolt at Attica prison. The settlement will be paid in the form of chocolate bars and packs of Newports that can be picked up in the commissary.\n5263\n0\n5264\n0\n5265\n0\n5266\n0\n5267\n0\n5268\nI'd seen the current stage production and the 1975 production of Chicago.

So in that sense the category was useful to me. But it's not useful to me as I write. I don't sit down to write an African-American zombie story or an African-American story about elevators. I'm writing a story about elevators which happens to talk about race in different ways. Or I'm writing a zombie novel which doesn't have that much to do with being black in America. That novel is really about survival.\n5287\n0\n5288\n0\n5289\n0\n5290\nCynicism is easy. An optimist is a braver cynic.\n5291\n0\n5292\n0\n5293\nGod created me to be an individual. And I am a Chicago dude that grew up the way I grew up and was named Rashid and was given a certain purpose and mission. So, I am rare for those reasons.\n5294\nNietzsche famously said \"Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\" But what he failed to stress is that it almost kills you.\n5295\n0\n5296\n0\n5297\nI started playing piano when I was around four; thats my first passion.\n5298\nEducation is transformational. It changes lives. That is why people work so hard to become educated and why education has always been the key to the American Dream, the force that erases arbitrary divisions of race and class and culture and unlocks every person's God-given potential.\n5299\n0\n5300\n0\n5301\n0\n5302\n0\n5303\n0\n5304\n0\n5305\n0\n5306\n0\n5307\n0\n5308\n0\n5309\n0\n5310\n0\n5311\n0\n5312\n0\n5313\n0\n5314\n0\n5315\n0\n5316\n0\n5317\n0\n5318\n0\n5319\n0\n5320\n0\n5321\n0\n5322\n0\n5323\n0\n5324\n0\n5325\nBe passionate, be optimistic, be grateful.\n5326\n0\n5327\n0\n5328\nI have on many occasions spoken my mind from stage. I have offered organizations table space by the merch booth. I have donated a dollar-a-ticket, or the entire guarantee, to different causes. I have registered voters.

I love alternative, rock, hip hop, rap, and I'll go to classical or jazz.\n5344\n0\n5345\n0\n5346\nOh, I see people everywhere. Some are celebs, but most of my friends are just regular people. The thing is, even celebs are normal people too. Just people.\n5347\n0\n5348\n0\n5349\n0\n5350\n0\n5351\n0\n5352\n0\n5353\n0\n5354\n0\n5355\nI am tired of the superficial smiles that adorn the many ghouls among us. I am tired of the righteous indignation that hides beneath those visages that feign our best interest and deign to think we cannot and will not stand for ourselves.\n5356\n0\n5357\n0\n5358\n0\n5359\n0\n5360\n0\n5361\n0\n5362\nWe have to recognise that there cannot be relationships unless there is commitment, unless there is loyalty, unless there is love, patience, persistence.\n5363\n0\n5364\n0\n5365\n0\n5366\n0\n5367\n0\n5368\n0\n5369\n0\n5370\n0\n5371\nGreatness is helping others realize they are great, beautiful and capable. Genius is seeing the wonder and possibility in those others ignore.\n5372\n0\n5373\n0\n5374\n0\n5375\n0\n5376\nThe American influence is not so aggressive anymore. The American big business influence in Latin America is not as strong, so people can vote and they can have a different life than before. They can have more liberal, more interesting, and more democratic governments.\n5377\n0\n5378\n0\n5379\n0\n5380\nAlways a godmother, never a mother. That sucks.

It's not like you go into music because it's going to make a lot of money. It's something you do... that's the thing. You got to accept all that hard work with it, too.

You have a bigger, wider world audience on the Internet, larger than any American television series. People don't watch television in the same context as before. Nowadays they watch their television on the Internet at their convenience. That's the whole wave, and it's now - not the future.\n5466\n0\n5467\n0\n5468\n0\n5469\n0\n5470\n0\n5471\nI still learn, but I think it's the best thing in life to have a kid.\n5472\n0\n5473\n0\n5474\n0\n5475\n0\n5476\n0\n5477\n0\n5478\n0\n5479\n0\n5480\n0\n5481\n0\n5482\n0\n5483\n0\n5484\n0\n5485\n0\n5486\n0\n5487\n0\n5488\nI think there's a lot you can learn from everybody; everybody has a story and a strength within them.\n5489\n0\n5490\n0\n5491\n0\n5492\n0\n5493\n0\n5494\n0\n5495\n0\n5496\n0\n5497\n0\n5498\n0\n5499\n0\n5500\n0\n5501\n0\n5502\n0\n5503\n0\n5504\n0\n5505\nFreedom brings opportunity, opportunity makes your future.\n5506\n0\n5507\n0\n5508\n0\n5509\nYour opinion of yourself becomes your reality.

And the part that's so unfair is that we call them 'big' and 'small' because when something happens to you, when you loose something or someone that your really care about, that's all there is. The world may be blowing up around you, but you don't care about that. You don't care about that at all.\n5593\n0\n5594\n0\n5595\n0\n5596\nAs you breathe in, cherish yourself.

Communism is an obvious example. But so is British imperialism, which was not grubby self-interest all the way down, but at least in part a sincere attempt on the part of people who felt they were superior to other people to magnanimously improve the lot of their inferiors.\n5609\n0\n5610\n0\n5611\n0\n5612\n0\n5613\n0\n5614\n0\n5615\n0\n5616\nSome countries need extra stimulus in specific areas.

But in the end, there is no way around it: The debt levels have to come down.\n5617\n0\n5618\n0\n5619\nTolerance obviously requires a non-contentious manner of relating toward one another’s differences. But tolerance does not require abandoning one’s standards or one’s opinions on political or public policy choices. Tolerance is a way of reacting to diversity, not a command to insulate it from examination.\n5620\n0\n5621\n0\n5622\n0\n5623\n0\n5624\n0\n5625\n0\n5626\n0\n5627\n0\n5628\nIn England we burnt redheads at the stake, because we thought they were witches. There are still young redheads in Britain getting ripped for having red hair. 'Oy, Ginger!'\n5629\n0\n5630\nFondness for people can be terrifying, because it's intangible and it can disappear, or it can be taken away, or you can say the wrong thing. A million things, so it's so uncomfortable. So when you suddenly become aware of it because they don't call you or something for half an hour or whatever, you lose it.\n5631\nToasting is basically what you call rapping.

For the scientist, the goal of a theory is to convey \"truth for now\"--to replace an old truth, while accepting that someday this theory, too, will be replaced by a new \"truth,\" because that is the way science advances.\n5853\nI studied architecture in New York.

But you probably want to throw yourselves into circumstances where the summons will come.\n6220\n0\n6221\n0\n6222\n0\n6223\n0\n6224\nI like a good story and I also like staring at the sea-- do I have to choose between the two?\n6225\n0\n6226\n0\n6227\nIf we left the European Union, it would be a one-way ticket, not a return.

I would pick songs based off a), whether I felt like I could do anything with them, and b) whether I felt like I could keep the story intact. And then you sit in with one of the piano players and one of the vocal coaches and kind of work out your arrangements that way.\n6250\n0\n6251\nThe inspiration for my illusions comes from many places. Most often they come from my dreams, or an everyday occurrence in life.\n6252\n0\n6253\n0\n6254\n0\n6255\n0\n6256\nAll romances end in tragedy. One of the key people in a romance becomes a monster sooner or later.\n6257\nWhile I was an addict, I didn't write anything. I didn't have the attention span or the will.\n6258\nAnd it's one more shitty thing to write about somebody, in between getting really, really, really upset at female Ghostbusters and Gamergate, and the things that really matter.\n6259\n0\n6260\n0\n6261\nThat's one of the peculiar things about bad moods - we often fool ourselves and create misery by telling ourselves things that simply are not true.\n6262\n0\n6263\n0\n6264\n0\n6265\n0\n6266\n0\n6267\n0\n6268\n0\n6269\n0\n6270\n0\n6271\n0\n6272\n0\n6273\n0\n6274\n0\n6275\n0\n6276\n0\n6277\n0\n6278\n0\n6279\n0\n6280\nYou're raising a kid and you give it food and shelter and, most importantly, you give it the feeling that it's special. I think people react to celebrities like that - I mean, they treat celebrities like children.\n6281\nJewish people have put the interests of race over the interests of the American people....

If parents use alcohol in moderation in front of young children, that provides the right model. Drug use is more complex because even moderate use can have unforeseen consequences.\n6295\n0\n6296\n0\n6297\n0\n6298\n0\n6299\n0\n6300\n0\n6301\n0\n6302\n0\n6303\n0\n6304\n0\n6305\n0\n6306\nThe thing I always say to any writer that I'm working with is: Just make sure that in any argument, EVERYONE is right.

I'm a huge movie buff. From studying and watching movies, over and over again, directly influential are Terrence Malik and his naturalism, Robert Altman and his exploration of improvisation, and Judd Apatow, in terms of his comedic process.\n6335\n0\n6336\nThe best way to think about anarchism is as a combination of three levels. On the one hand, the sort of instinctual revulsion against forms of inequality in power; on the other hand, a reappraisal of what one is already doing in egalitarian relations; and then the projection of these principles on all sorts of relations.\n6337\n0\n6338\n0\n6339\n0\n6340\n0\n6341\n0\n6342\n0\n6343\n0\n6344\n0\n6345\n0\n6346\n0\n6347\n0\n6348\nI wanna be a nice guy.\n6349\n0\n6350\n0\n6351\n0\n6352\n0\n6353\n0\n6354\n0\n6355\nI'm trying to write something in which you know that it's all about sex but you never see any.\n6356\n0\n6357\nThe main substantive achievement of neoliberalism has been to redistribute rather than to generate wealth and income.\n6358\nI look good, but I probably have the insides of Elvis.\n6359\nThe Klit brothers should first fight each other, and the winner should fight me.\n6360\n0\n6361\n0\n6362\n0\n6363\n0\n6364\n0\n6365\n0\n6366\n0\n6367\n0\n6368\n0\n6369\nI'm always excited by the unlikely, never by ordinary things.\n6370\n0\n6371\n0\n6372\n0\n6373\nPolitics is about winning. If you don't win, you don't get to put your principles into practice. Therefore, find a way to win, or sit the battle out.\n6374\nWe can't control what the ratings will be. It's like, if you're going to go skiing, do you hope you'll have a good day of skiing? Yes. Do you hope you won't break your leg? Yes.\n6375\nThere are two things you need if you are to uncover and communicate what is really happening in the world. One is to free of any dogmatic belief system. The second is not to give a damn what people think and say about you, or, at least, not to let that influence your decisions.\n6376\n0\n6377\n0\n6378\n0\n6379\n0\n6380\n0\n6381\n0\n6382\n0\n6383\n0\n6384\n0\n6385\nWe can embrace change by knowing we serve an unchanging God.\n6386\n0\n6387\nWhen I was a kid, I had some Charles Lloyd records.\n6388\n0\n6389\n0\n6390\n0\n6391\n0\n6392\n0\n6393\n0\n6394\n0\n6395\nOne reason why people find applying the Bible to work so difficult is that the world of Scriptures seems so distant from our modern world today. Many established realities we encounter daily, like non-profit and for-profit corporations, did not exist in the ancient world.\n6396\n0\n6397\n0\n6398\n0\n6399\n0\n6400\n0\n6401\nSomeone is spending their life and their passion and their ingenuity on something that's seemingly potentially trite. But it's what they're doing, and it's what's important to them and what's beautiful to them.\n6402\n0\n6403\n0\n6404\n0\n6405\n0\n6406\nI had this duality growing up with my dad being a strict Catholic and his brother being a priest and my mother finding God in nature, so I've taken a little from both [traditions].\n6407\n0\n6408\n0\n6409\n0\n6410\n0\n6411\n0\n6412\n0\n6413\n0\n6414\n0\n6415\n0\n6416\nThe light you see at the end of the tunnel is the front of an oncoming train.\n6417\n0\n6418\n0\n6419\n0\n6420\n0\n6421\nThe White House is saying Donald Trump has 'zero percent chance' of being elected.

There's not an abundance of pilots. There may be an abundance of cheap fuel and airplanes. There probably isn't an abundance of gates at popular airports, either.\n6481\n0\n6482\n0\n6483\n0\n6484\nI think any spiritual experience that's worthwhile is not about ego and it will humble you in some way. And also, a Zen monk once said to me, 'If you're not laughing, then you're not getting it.'\n6485\n0\n6486\n0\n6487\n0\n6488\n0\n6489\n0\n6490\n0\n6491\n0\n6492\n0\n6493\nMartin Luther King was a voice to the voiceless, and he did that tirelessly, and his faith was the engine to that. But he was just a human being, at the end of the day.\n6494\n0\n6495\n0\n6496\n0\n6497\nWhen I was younger and bands were formed that way, out of friendships rather than anything else. It wasn't like we put up want ads.\n6498\n0\n6499\nI'm not so sure that I am a reductionist in the strict type-identity sense. The issues here are messy. But I certainly a reductionist in the more general sense which is opposed to eliminativism and dualism.\n6500\n0\n6501\n0\n6502\n0\n6503\n0\n6504\n0\n6505\n0\n6506\nThe progress in Iraq is still fragile. And it could still be reversed. Iraq still faces innumerable challenges, and they will be evident during what will likely be a difficult process as the newly elected Council of Representatives selects the next prime minister, president, and speaker of the council.\n6507\nDon't underestimate what God can do with ordinary people.\n6508\n0\n6509\nI'm very lucky to be able to work in print and radio. I'm very lucky to be able to work at a time when finance and economics are really important. And the number of people who tell finance and economic stories in a kind of accessible storytelling way, there's much more demand than there is supply.\n6510\n0\n6511\n0\n6512\n0\n6513\n0\n6514\n0\n6515\n0\n6516\n0\n6517\n0\n6518\n0\n6519\n0\n6520\n0\n6521\nI used to read only fiction.

And then I would make weekly comics for my weekly papers. It was on two parallel tracks. And then they all got collected in a book.\n6530\nI am an adult; deliberately naïve, dewy-eyed optimism is not the proper posture for a responsible adult, is it?\n6531\n0\n6532\n0\n6533\n0\n6534\n0\n6535\n0\n6536\n0\n6537\n0\n6538\n0\n6539\n0\n6540\n0\n6541\n0\n6542\n0\n6543\n0\n6544\n0\n6545\n0\n6546\n0\n6547\n0\n6548\n0\n6549\n0\n6550\n0\n6551\n0\n6552\nNo one's quite figured out how to make the images come to the viewer. I guess if they put it on a conveyor belt, you could stand in one place like at sushi restaurants. That could be a next generation of museums. Someone should try that. I think ideally you want to have a contemplative space for the viewer. And shuffling around like a chain gang does work against that.\n6553\n0\n6554\n0\n6555\n0\n6556\n0\n6557\n0\n6558\nI think I'm a very very nice director. Very supportive, very nurturing. I definitely try to challenge my actors but I think I'm very supportive.\n6559\n0\n6560\nIt's odd the things that people remember. Parents will arrange a birthday party, certain it will stick in your mind forever. You'll have a nice time, then two years later you'll be like, 'There was a pony there? Really?

If America disappeared off the face of the Earth today, the greatest single cultural loss would be blues, jazz, hip-hop, R&B, rock-and-roll.\n6573\n0\n6574\n0\n6575\n0\n6576\nI think drawing is really the basis of all art, even sculpture, film. The greatest filmmakers have always been able to at least roughly sketch out their ideas in storyboards. And black and white in particular is a good place to start.\n6577\n0\n6578\n0\n6579\n0\n6580\nI never dated much in high school or college.\n6581\n0\n6582\n0\n6583\n0\n6584\n0\n6585\n0\n6586\n0\n6587\n0\n6588\nThe stock market in Japan was half the world market and where has the Japan economy gone since the 1990s? Nowhere. They've been struggling for two decades in the aftermath of a massive bubble that's collapsed. They've tried to work their way out of it by printing even more money and it hasn't worked. Now, I'm saying this is what all the central banks are doing. There is no honest interest rate in the world today.\n6589\n0\n6590\nInevitably, every part an actor plays contains some of himself.\n6591\n0\n6592\n0\n6593\n0\n6594\n0\n6595\n0\n6596\n0\n6597\nI remember a conversation with my parents about who the people on the TV were, and learning they were actors and they acted out this story and just thinking that was the most fantastic notion, and that's what I want to do.\n6598\n0\n6599\n0\n6600\n0\n6601\n0\n6602\n0\n6603\nIf I'd thought, \"I can't really play this instrument,\" I wouldn't have done it!

I just fell in love with learning the guitar, and I wanted to learn songs and chords, and that led to wanting to start a band, and to wanting to do our first show.\n7335\n0\n7336\n0\n7337\n0\n7338\n0\n7339\n0\n7340\n0\n7341\nCNN says it did not share its coverage materials with any candidate, party or campaign and says it was completely uncomfortable with [Donna] Brazile's involvement with the [Hillary] Clinton camp.\n7342\n0\n7343\n0\n7344\n0\n7345\n0\n7346\n0\n7347\n0\n7348\n0\n7349\n0\n7350\nIts really easy to get colors right. Its really hard to get black - and neutrals - right. Black is certainly a color but its also an illusion.\n7351\n0\n7352\n0\n7353\n0\n7354\n0\n7355\n0\n7356\n0\n7357\n0\n7358\n0\n7359\n0\n7360\n0\n7361\n0\n7362\nWhen I looked at the painting I felt the same convergence on a single point: a flickering sun-struck instance that existed now and forever. Only occasionally did I notice the chain on the finch's ankle, or think what a cruel life for a little living creature - fluttering briefly, forced always to land in the same hopeless place.\n7363\n0\n7364\n0\n7365\n0\n7366\n0\n7367\n0\n7368\n0\n7369\nTo me it is harder to play a real person, but when you do it and you feel good about it and the person feels good about it, I think that's doubly rewarding. So the challenge is greater, the risk is greater, but the reward is greater as well.\n7370\nI spent a couple of years doing American films. I did a few.\n7371\nJapanese music was so crazy! The J-pop and everything. I never scooped up an album or anything.\n7372\n0\n7373\n0\n7374\n0\n7375\n0\n7376\n0\n7377\n0\n7378\n0\n7379\n0\n7380\n0\n7381\n0\n7382\nInstead of searching for what you want externally, concentrate on developing mental pictures of your desires. Surround these images with feelings of security, gratitude, and faith; and know that what you’ve been looking for is on its way to you right now.\n7383\n0\n7384\n0\n7385\nI would say my life experiences are my poetry, whether I'm writing about those actual, factual experiences or not.\n7386\n0\n7387\n0\n7388\n0\n7389\n0\n7390\nPoliticians generally form alliances and not friendships.  Individuals and institutions achieve their ends through continual barter.  But deals are not bonds.  Indeed, intense emotional involvement with anything - with issues, ideology, a woman, even a family - can be a handicap, not only consuming valuable time, but more importantly, reducing flexibility and the capacity for detached calculation needed to take maximum advantage of continually changing circumstances.\n7391\n0\n7392\n0\n7393\n0\n7394\n0\n7395\n0\n7396\n0\n7397\n0\n7398\n0\n7399\n0\n7400\n0\n7401\n0\n7402\n0\n7403\n0\n7404\n0\n7405\n0\n7406\n0\n7407\nI get a message from Stephen Falk saying, \"Hey, if I wrote a part for you in You're The Worst, would you do it?\" I was like, \"Yes!\" And then, of course, later I found out it's going to be me playing myself sort of Larry Sanders-style where I'm the total opposite of what people would expect me to be. I was just like, \"Okay, what the hell.\" But it's really funny to portray me as somebody who is pretending to be a stoner just to succeed.\n7408\n0\n7409\n0\n7410\n0\n7411\n0\n7412\n0\n7413\n0\n7414\n0\n7415\n0\n7416\n0\n7417\n0\n7418\n0\n7419\n0\n7420\n0\n7421\n0\n7422\n0\n7423\nIn particular, I'm drawn to the stories that have big, high concepts and real characters at their heart. And I love where those two worlds meet, and 'Edge of Tomorrow' is the perfect canvas to explore that.\n7424\n0\n7425\n0\n7426\n0\n7427\n0\n7428\n0\n7429\n0\n7430\n0\n7431\n0\n7432\n0\n7433\n0\n7434\n0\n7435\n0\n7436\n0\n7437\n0\n7438\nI wish the 50 states would break up. Lose the centralised government. More choice. How do you want to live, there's 50 different ways! You hate black people? We've a state for that. You wanna have an abortion? Here's a state. I think we should just keep breaking up countries now so they become just individuals.\n7439\n0\n7440\n0\n7441\n0\n7442\n0\n7443\n0\n7444\n0\n7445\n0\n7446\nI dreamt of being an actor ever since I was young.\n7447\n0\n7448\n0\n7449\n0\n7450\n0\n7451\nEarth was not built for six billion people all running around and being passionate about things. The world was built for about two million people foraging for roots and grubs.\n7452\n0\n7453\n0\n7454\n0\n7455\n0\n7456\n0\n7457\n0\n7458\n0\n7459\n0\n7460\n0\n7461\n0\n7462\n0\n7463\n0\n7464\n0\n7465\n0\n7466\n0\n7467\n0\n7468\n0\n7469\n0\n7470\n0\n7471\n0\n7472\nThe plague did not lead to Europe’s economic collapse. Rather, Europe’s currency-driven economic collapse led to the plague.\n7473\n0\n7474\n0\n7475\n0\n7476\n0\n7477\n0\n7478\n0\n7479\n0\n7480\n0\n7481\n0\n7482\n0\n7483\n0\n7484\n0\n7485\n0\n7486\nThe Nuclear Industry is conducting a war against humanity.\n7487\nI like when money makes a difference but don't make you different\n7488\n0\n7489\n0\n7490\n0\n7491\n0\n7492\n0\n7493\n0\n7494\n0\n7495\nThere are so many pressures that are put upon young women. Whatever we can do to alleviate that and help women feel beautiful about who we are inside, which is the only beauty there truly is, is so nice. Let's get down and dirty. Let's be a real girl.\n7496\n0\n7497\nWe had a saying that the fun stops at one.\n7498\n0\n7499\n0\n7500\n0\n7501\n0\n7502\n0\n7503\n0\n7504\n0\n7505\n0\n7506\n0\n7507\n0\n7508\n0\n7509\n0\n7510\n0\n7511\n0\n7512\n0\n7513\n0\n7514\n0\n7515\n0\n7516\n0\n7517\n0\n7518\nWe were young. We were 23. I was a kid, growing up, that would burn and fry. I didn't understand why. We did all this study and research and learned so much about skin cells and rejuvenation and how the body works and (how) everybody is different. (We) learned what doctors do for treatment of certain things and so I changed my direction and opened up a skin-care company - healthy tanning, skin-care products and rejuvenation and all of that and it took off.\n7519\n0\n7520\n0\n7521\n0\n7522\n0\n7523\n0\n7524\n0\n7525\n0\n7526\n0\n7527\n0\n7528\n0\n7529\n0\n7530\n0\n7531\n0\n7532\n0\n7533\n0\n7534\n0\n7535\n0\n7536\n0\n7537\n0\n7538\n0\n7539\nI had severed relations with the Romanian exiles who had become politically conservative and even extremely right wing; I was giving chess lessons to earn a living. Luckily we spoke quite a bit of French at home so it wasn't too difficult for me to write in my adopted language.\n7540\n0\n7541\n0\n7542\n0\n7543\n0\n7544\n0\n7545\n0\n7546\nOne of the things I think is unique and signature about Blizzard is that whenever they do their games, and with Warcraft in particular, they take the things they love and put a twist on it. They showed that heroes can come from the most unexpected places, and as a player, you can play as a hero, on all sides.\n7547\n0\n7548\n0\n7549\n0\n7550\n0\n7551\n0\n7552\nMcLeod's Daughters was my first regular job out of drama school, and my first full-time role. That was great because I learned a lot, in terms of working in front of the camera. I learned a lot of technical aspects that you take for granted once you know them, but you have to learn them somewhere, along the way. It was a bit of a training ground for me, working in front of the camera and also dealing with media.\n7553\nI'm not a big radio guy, I don't listen to whatever is the hip new thing.\n7554\nWhat makes divorce happen is that you can't be in the same space any more, for whatever reason - but the love stays. And that's the killer. That's where the vehemence and anger and rage comes from.\n7555\n0\n7556\n0\n7557\n0\n7558\n0\n7559\n0\n7560\n0\n7561\n0\n7562\n0\n7563\n0\n7564\n0\n7565\n0\n7566\n0\n7567\n0\n7568\n0\n7569\n0\n7570\n0\n7571\n0\n7572\nThink back 5 yrs ago. Think of where you're at today. Think ahead 5 yrs and what you want to accomplish. Be Unstoppable.\n7573\nThe Silvertop and the Goldtop both had subtlety where it was needed but lots of definition as well. I liked the different voicings of the distortion/fuzz elements.\n7574\n0\n7575\n0\n7576\n0\n7577\n0\n7578\nI want to be held accountable. I want my teammates and my coaches to push me to be the best that I can be.\n7579\n0\n7580\n0\n7581\nIn retrospect I wrote things about my life and my family's existence, I realized that it was a frighteningly harsh way to make a living. And I used to say that they were slowly dying trying to make a living.\n7582\n0\n7583\nImmediately after games, we're talking about what we need to do for the next game. We're not satisfied in the moment that we're in.\n7584\n0\n7585\n0\n7586\n0\n7587\n0\n7588\n0\n7589\nStyle is innate to who I am. My father gave me a picture the other day. I must have been about seven, and I had on wing-tip shoes and some cool pants. I thought, 'Wow!'\n7590\nNothing can make me feel better now, except cocaine.\n7591\nI love doing stunt stuff and action stuff. I'm not flipping off helicopters; that would be insane.\n7592\n0\n7593\n0\n7594\n0\n7595\n0\n7596\n0\n7597\n0\n7598\n0\n7599\n0\n7600\n0\n7601\nI actually think there are more Republicans than people realize who would be sympathetic to immigration reform in the rank and file. I think the lesson for Jeb Bush is politicians shouldn't write books with long lead times.\n7602\n0\n7603\n0\n7604\n0\n7605\nI think virgins are far more interesting to write about. If we've been around the block a few times, we know what to expect. Not so with virgins.\n7606\n0\n7607\n0\n7608\nTrue character arises from a deeper well than religion.\n7609\n0\n7610\n0\n7611\n0\n7612\n0\n7613\n0\n7614\n0\n7615\n0\n7616\n0\n7617\n0\n7618\n0\n7619\n0\n7620\n0\n7621\n0\n7622\n0\n7623\n0\n7624\n0\n7625\nPeople think artists like 50 Cent don't have charisma, but it's just a different kind of charisma, a bully charisma, which is kinda frowned upon.\n7626\n0\n7627\n0\n7628\n0\n7629\n0\n7630\n0\n7631\n0\n7632\n0\n7633\n0\n7634\n0\n7635\n0\n7636\n0\n7637\nI want to help put some of the pieces together for people. I want to empower people so they don't have to keep going to others outside of themselves for guidance.\n7638\n0\n7639\nThe sun never sets. It is only an appearance due to the observer's limited perspective. And yet, what a sublime illusion it is.\n7640\n0\n7641\n0\n7642\n0\n7643\n0\n7644\n0\n7645\nThe food in Yugoslavia is fine if you like pork tartare.\n7646\n0\n7647\n0\n7648\n0\n7649\n0\n7650\n0\n7651\n0\n7652\n0\n7653\n0\n7654\n0\n7655\n0\n7656\n0\n7657\n0\n7658\n0\n7659\n0\n7660\n0\n7661\n0\n7662\n0\n7663\n0\n7664\nI'm not an activist per se, but I have strong feelings about things. People can jump on celebrities for being ill-informed or naive, but I've got a right to say what I believe\n7665\nI cannot stress this enough - if you try to install an HDTV in a non-HDTV compatible house, you may tear the space-time continuum.\n7666\n0\n7667\n0\n7668\n0\n7669\n0\n7670\n0\n7671\n0\n7672\n0\n7673\n0\n7674\n0\n7675\n0\n7676\n0\n7677\n0\n7678\n0\n7679\n0\n7680\n0\n7681\n0\n7682\n0\n7683\n0\n7684\n0\n7685\n0\n7686\n0\n7687\nI think the moment you start trying to please a fan base is when you start going downhill. I'm going to always, always write about what I want, even if it doesn't necessarily cater to most of them.\n7688\n0\n7689\n0\n7690\n0\n7691\nIf I look at the people that I look up to, a lot of them don't come to the forefront until their early to mid-30s. I think the most exciting roles are definitely yet to come.\n7692\n0\n7693\n0\n7694\n0\n7695\n'Villain' is such a harsh word.\n7696\n0\n7697\n0\n7698\n0\n7699\n0\n7700\n0\n7701\n0\n7702\n0\n7703\n0\n7704\n0\n7705\n0\n7706\n0\n7707\n0\n7708\n0\n7709\nIt was frustrating because I didn't do anything, ... I was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and he decided to punish me. I couldn't do anything about it.\n7710\n0\n7711\n0\n7712\nCats have a scam going - you buy the food, they eat the food, they go away; that's the deal.\n7713\n0\n7714\n0\n7715\n0\n7716\n0\n7717\n0\n7718\nI'm not one of these actors who can make a bad script good. Some actors, a script can be terrible, and they can bring something to it and make it really special. I can't.\n7719\n0\n7720\n0\n7721\n0\n7722\nIs it just me, or does every woman in New York have a severe emotional problem?\n7723\n0\n7724\n0\n7725\nI always try to describe making movies like summer camp, or some holiday where you spend all day, every day with a new group of people whom you kind of love and then never see again.\n7726\n0\n7727\n0\n7728\n0\n7729\n0\n7730\n0\n7731\nSociety, you're a crazy breed.\n7732\n0\n7733\n0\n7734\nThe Dutch have a can-do mentality, anything is possible. As long as you pay for it. It is very capitalist. Quite American in a way.\n7735\n0\n7736\n0\n7737\n0\n7738\n0\n7739\nIn general, Americans like to be entertained.

It definitely is, but the payoff is you get to go home to your kids, and it all balances out.

Einstein struggled to bring quantum mechanics and gravity together and never succeeded, and that's a problem that to this day is not well understood. Well, maybe to comprehend some of these things, we need to augment our intelligence. If we do, who knows?\n7785\nNewlyweds shooting budget: 5k for actors, 2k insurance, 2k food and drink. 9k in the can. We only shot 12 days.

We're talking about, you know, counseling and speaking, so that's one. That can be reversed by an executive order. [George W.]Bush put it in the first day he got in office. We hope that [Barack] Obama takes it out. He had cut off funding for the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, even though Congress had appropriated. It is injured women who are the poorest of the poor.\n7898\n0\n7899\n0\n7900\n0\n7901\n0\n7902\n0\n7903\n0\n7904\n0\n7905\n0\n7906\n0\n7907\n0\n7908\n0\n7909\n0\n7910\n0\n7911\n0\n7912\nI'm just trying to take what the defense gives me.\n7913\n0\n7914\nI want an iPhone 5, someone said something nasty on twitter, or my boyfriend isn't texting me back, like whatever the thing is that seems so major in your life, when a real disaster hits you suddenly strips it all away and you see what's really important and who you really are.\n7915\n0\n7916\nIt's crucial to choose your work place - some places lend themselves to you and others don't.\n7917\n0\n7918\n0\n7919\n0\n7920\n0\n7921\n0\n7922\nHow can love be worthy of its name if one selects solely the pretty things and leaves out the hardships? It is easy to enjoy the good and dislike the bad. Anybody can do that. The real challenge is to love the good and the bad together, not because you need to take the rough with the smooth but because you need to go beyond such descriptions and accept love in its entirety.\n7923\n0\n7924\n0\n7925\nI'm just always looking for something that I've never done, or something that feels unique and special. A lot of it is gut and what you emotionally connect with, and that can be a variety of different things.\n7926\n0\n7927\n0\n7928\n0\n7929\n0\n7930\n0\n7931\n0\n7932\n0\n7933\n0\n7934\nImagine if investors in Wal-Mart really cared about bribery at that company's overseas operations or safety standards at its overseas manufacturing plants. If investors pulled their capital, corporate leaders would have to respond.\n7935\n0\n7936\n0\n7937\n0\n7938\n0\n7939\n0\n7940\n0\n7941\n0\n7942\n0\n7943\n0\n7944\n0\n7945\n0\n7946\n0\n7947\n0\n7948\n0\n7949\n0\n7950\n0\n7951\nI love horror films, so I guess it's one of those things where I find myself interested in the script.\n7952\n0\n7953\n0\n7954\n0\n7955\n0\n7956\nIf we were to see Western landay poems, we'd see them out of disenfranchised populations, maybe out of the legacy of slavery. Spirituals, rap music - that would be the space we'd find American landays in.\n7957\n0\n7958\n0\n7959\n0\n7960\nI really just drew off of where we are now, with reality TV. You can't help but see a lot of it. You choose to watch some, but with some, you just can't help but hear it and see it. It's just piercing in your brain. That piercing is what I was tapping into , with whatever they were doing to pierce into the minds of everybody. It takes a certain kind of person to shut your mind off to the consequences and just try to get results. That's what I was going for - results.\n7961\n0\n7962\n0\n7963\n0\n7964\n0\n7965\n0\n7966\n0\n7967\n0\n7968\n0\n7969\n0\n7970\n0\n7971\n0\n7972\n0\n7973\n0\n7974\n0\n7975\nYou have to participate relentlessly in the manifestation of your own blessings.\n7976\n0\n7977\n0\n7978\n0\n7979\n0\n7980\n0\n7981\n0\n7982\n0\n7983\n0\n7984\n0\n7985\n0\n7986\n0\n7987\n0\n7988\n0\n7989\n0\n7990\n0\n7991\n0\n7992\n0\n7993\n0\n7994\nThere is nothing in my life where I view myself as a 1920s person.\n7995\n0\n7996\nI was embarrassed that I even wanted to become an actress because coming from L.A., with two older sisters in the business and a mom who had been a ballet dancer, it was such a cliche.\n7997\n0\n7998\n0\n7999\n0\n8000\n0\n8001\n0\n8002\n0\n8003\n0\n8004\n0\n8005\n0\n8006\n0\n8007\nOlive's private view is that life depends on what she thinks of as \"big bursts\" and \"little bursts.\" Big bursts are things like marriage or children, intimacies that keep you afloat, but these big bursts hold dangerous, unseen currents. Which is why you need the little bursts as well: a friendly clerk at Bradlee's, let's say, or the waitress at Dunkin' Donuts who knows how you like your coffee. Tricky business, really.\n8008\n0\n8009\n0\n8010\nIt's powerfully important that our kids get an education in personal finance.\n8011\nA part of me will always be unflyable, stuck in the climb.\n8012\n0\n8013\n0\n8014\n0\n8015\nMy parents brought me up on all different styles of music, like my Mum would listen to Motown R&B and my Dad was quite 80's driven, so I was always surrounded by music growing up.\n8016\n0\n8017\nFor my own style, I love vintage. 60's and 70's are my favorite. I love baby doll dresses and the soft colors. I try to mix a little bit of modern into that - maybe I'll wear it with boots. At my school we wear a uniform, but we have one day a week we can wear whatever we want.\n8018\n0\n8019\n0\n8020\n0\n8021\n0\n8022\n0\n8023\n0\n8024\nDo we have to know who's gay and who's straight? Can't we just love everybody and judge them by the car they drive?\n8025\n0\n8026\n0\n8027\n0\n8028\n0\n8029\n0\n8030\n0\n8031\n0\n8032\n0\n8033\nEventually, it becomes a matter of scale. When the good outweighs the bad, you stay. When the bad is the only thing you notice anymore, you think about your future, or what's left of it, consider options.\n8034\n0\n8035\nIn Liberia, our main obstacle is infrastructure: the lights, the water, the roads. Companies can't operate without those things. And even though we have commitments from our partners, it takes time to turn commitments into cash.\n8036\n0\n8037\n0\n8038\n0\n8039\n0\n8040\n0\n8041\n0\n8042\n0\n8043\n0\n8044\n0\n8045\nI call myself a feminist when people ask me if I am, and of course I am 'cause it's about equality, so I hope everyone is. You know you're working in a patriarchal society when the word \"feminist\" has a weird connotation.\n8046\n0\n8047\n0\n8048\n0\n8049\n0\n8050\n0\n8051\n0\n8052\n0\n8053\n0\n8054\n0\n8055\n0\n8056\nI tend to write things and review it afterwards and realise what comes out. I very rarely ever write something and have to take it back.\n8057\n0\n8058\n0\n8059\n0\n8060\n0\n8061\n0\n8062\n0\n8063\n0\n8064\n0\n8065\n0\n8066\n0\n8067\n0\n8068\n0\n8069\n0\n8070\nJust as thought experiments can't show that vitalism is true (or that it is false), they also can't show that dualism is true (or that it is false).\n8071\n0\n8072\n0\n8073\n0\n8074\n0\n8075\n0\n8076\n0\n8077\n0\n8078\nThe biggest mistake, in general, I've made, is to put too much of a weighting on someone's talent and not enough on their personality. And I've made that mistake several times. I think it actually matters whether somebody has a good heart, it really does. I've made the mistake of thinking that it's sometimes just about the brain.\n8079\n0\n8080\n0\n8081\n0\n8082\n0\n8083\nI think people should be free to engage in any sexual practices they choose; they should draw the line at goats, though.\n8084\n0\n8085\n0\n8086\n0\n8087\nMaybe I just never learned my harmony part, because what everybody says sounds odd to them sounds perfectly natural to me.\n8088\n0\n8089\n0\n8090\n0\n8091\n0\n8092\n0\n8093\n0\n8094\n0\n8095\n0\n8096\n0\n8097\nClown' was written when I couldn't find anyone who believed in me as an artist. Maybe those labels will think twice next time a young songwriter comes along.\n8098\nI had these recipes that say do this, do that. Who MAKES these rules?\n8099\n0\n8100\n0\n8101\n0\n8102\nThere’s something about the good-hearted guy fighting the system. I just love that. That’s how Speed is. He’s a really focused guy with a heart of gold and the corporations are trying to crush him and use him for his skills to make them more money.\n8103\n0\n8104\n0\n8105\n0\n8106\n0\n8107\n0\n8108\n0\n8109\n0\n8110\n0\n8111\n0\n8112\n0\n8113\nI'm on a health kick! I'm drawn to cheeseburgers, so I've got to just try and keep it on an even keel.\n8114\nOften, people who want to make interesting films simply don't have the money to do it.\n8115\n0\n8116\nI have a treadmill, and I work out with my trainer, Julie Diamond, as often as possible. She's so positive.\n8117\n0\n8118\nBut now we have time. Endless time stretches before us.\n8119\n0\n8120\nI think every musician is different, every artist is different, and in a perfect world people would be able to pursue their own path and have the inspiration and the drive to, and the energy and dedication to take their path to its fruition. I don't really believe in formulas.\n8121\n0\n8122\n0\n8123\n0\n8124\n0\n8125\n0\n8126\n0\n8127\n0\n8128\n0\n8129\nI never felt I was quite the ticket academically. I always felt I had to put in an enormous amount of effort not to be disappointing. So I worked really hard, but at the time it suited me, because I didn't do very much else.\n8130\n0\n8131\n0\n8132\n0\n8133\nIn college, I was a weather anchor for the local news. I would 'borrow' my forecast from The Weather Channel.\n8134\n0\n8135\nWhen I was 14, a lot of people said, \"She's such a good actress, she loves theater, she looks like a woman, she should consider moving to L.A. and trying to do this professionally.\" My parents were hesitant, but they would take me.\n8136\n0\n8137\n0\n8138\n0\n8139\nSo we must love, while these moments are still called today, take part in the pain of this passion play, stretching our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust, until time makes history of us.\n8140\n0\n8141\n0\n8142\nTailoring your clothes makes all the difference.\n8143\n0\n8144\nI am against lying, but just because someone asks a question does not mean you have to answer it.\n8145\nJust be yourself, the minute you start being yourself youre gonna win.\n8146\n0\n8147\n0\n8148\n0\n8149\n0\n8150\n0\n8151\n0\n8152\n0\n8153\n0\n8154\nPeople don't always want to be with people. It gets tiring.\n8155\nI don't see what's so good about being genuine. Clog dancing is genuine. Isn't being fake more of an achievement? At least it takes some inspiration. Like, sherbet dips, they're a special food. Think of all the additives and coloring and grinding that it takes to create a sherbet dip. But carrots? They're just out there, shrieking, \"Hi, we're some carrots! Love us for it!\" They never have to prove themselves.\n8156\n0\n8157\n0\n8158\n0\n8159\n0\n8160\nBecause I'm very petite, I try not to wear things that have a heavy pattern because I feel like they overtake you.\n8161\nMy absolute favorite kind of people in the world are people that are passionate about something.\n8162\nChildren don't need much advice but they really do need to be listened to and not just with half an ear.\n8163\n0\n8164\nFeminism is equality: politically; culturally; socially; economically. That's it, that simple.\n8165\n0\n8166\n0\n8167\nPersonally, I don't think it's possible to do great things alone or through individual actions. On the contrary, I think it is only possible to know what to do in a specific moment once you have understood the zeitgeist, and it is only possible to move things forward if you have a sense of responsibility. And that is exactly the goal I have set for myself: to try to encourage France and the French people to change and develop further.\n8168\n0\n8169\n0\n8170\n0\n8171\n0\n8172\nSomeone once told me that the most dynamic actors are people who have stories. People who have lived life. People with experiences.\n8173\n0\n8174\n0\n8175\n0\n8176\n0\n8177\nI'm an enigma, an unknown. You can't really figure out what I'm going to do next. I like it like that.\n8178\nSometimes I vocalize in the car. It's a good way to multitask. Although fellow drivers on the road think I'm craaaazy.\n8179\nI love singing. The joy of singing live - I don't think I will ever stop that.\n8180\nI told my wife she looks sexy with black fingernails. Now she thinks I slammed the car door on her hand on purpose.\n8181\n0\n8182\n0\n8183\n0\n8184\n0\n8185\n0\n8186\n0\n8187\n0\n8188\n0\n8189\n0\n8190\n0\n8191\n0\n8192\nIf you're buying an album because of the face on it, you're stupid.\n8193\nThe relationship between the United States and Mexico goes over and beyond the relationship between two governments. This is a relationship that has been built as of two peoples who have a common life, or millions of people who have their everyday lives in both nations; a relationship that undoubtedly involves millions of inhabitants of both countries.\n8194\n0\n8195\n0\n8196\n0\n8197\n0\n8198\n0\n8199\n0\n8200\n0\n8201\n0\n8202\n0\n8203\n0\n8204\n0\n8205\n0\n8206\n0\n8207\n0\n8208\n0\n8209\n0\n8210\n0\n8211\nI do think homophobia in the '80s was more rampant and socially acceptable.\n8212\n0\n8213\n0\n8214\n0\n8215\nI'd love to say that every move I make is completely calculated and I'm sitting on a pile of scripts, sifting through them for the perfect role, but the fact is that there are a lot of talented people out there and there's a lot of competition in our business.\n8216\nWe shot that in Morocco, and got out of the country at the beginning of July - and two months later came the attack on Twin Towers. The movie was then released in December, so that kind of atmosphere is not something that was unfamiliar to me.\n8217\n0\n8218\n0\n8219\nWhat's working for me is like when I go into the studio, I'm trying to get goosebumps.\n8220\n0\n8221\n0\n8222\n0\n8223\n0\n8224\nI think it's important here to keep something in mind. I mean, when you're looking at last night and you see Matt Lauer unable to tell [Donald Trump], \"Hey, you know what? You're lying here.\"\n8225\n0\n8226\n0\n8227\nBritain, and my hometown, will always be with me wherever I go and whatever I do - but I prefer to live in California.\n8228\n0\n8229\n0\n8230\nWhen I was a child I had a dream to become a football player. I always played as I played when I was a child. I tried to improve. I never dreamt of becoming a professional football player, I dreamed just to play with the best players in the best team. I never dreamed to be paid to play. I would have paid to play an FA Cup Final in front of 80,000 people in Wembley. I just tried to play the wonderful game that football is. So, I hope young players will still have this dream.\n8231\n0\n8232\n0\n8233\n0\n8234\nI can't stand making records.\n8235\n0\n8236\n0\n8237\n0\n8238\n0\n8239\n0\n8240\n0\n8241\n0\n8242\nMost of the hits I take come on top of the shoulder pads.\n8243\n0\n8244\nFor me, I can't tell you if the film is good or bad, all I can say is for me the film is way better than I had expectation of us being able to make. So for me that's the most important thing. Have we exceeded our dream in terms of what it could be?\n8245\n0\n8246\n0\n8247\n0\n8248\n0\n8249\n0\n8250\n0\n8251\n0\n8252\n0\n8253\n0\n8254\n0\n8255\nWhen you compare what people endured in the South in the 60s to try to get the right to vote for African Americans, and to compare what people were subjected to there to what happened in Philadelphia - which was inappropriate, certainly that . . . to describe it in those terms I think does a great disservice to people who put their lives on the line, who risked all, for my people.\n8256\n0\n8257\n0\n8258\nJohn Cleese once told me he'd do anything for money. So I offered him a pound to shut up, and he took it.\n8259\n0\n8260\n0\n8261\n0\n8262\n0\n8263\n0\n8264\n0\n8265\n0\n8266\n0\n8267\nYou think you're funny? I think I'm adorable.\n8268\n0\n8269\n0\n8270\n0\n8271\nI've been trying to give as much attention and focus to my life as well as my career. It's hard because the career is money, but putting that before day-to-day needs isn't something that can last indefinitely. I'm excited to begin the next chapter of my life with an amazing woman.\n8272\n0\n8273\n0\n8274\n0\n8275\n0\n8276\n0\n8277\n0\n8278\n0\n8279\nI like playing a character every day. I like having something to go back to. I always enjoyed that with 'Will & Grace.' I like the camaraderie. I like having a crew that I know and I can work with every day.\n8280\n0\n8281\n0\n8282\n0\n8283\n0\n8284\n0\n8285\n0\n8286\n0\n8287\nObviously California is fantastic in terms of produce, vegetables.\n8288\n0\n8289\n0\n8290\n0\n8291\n0\n8292\n0\n8293\nI've written about illegal immigrants in the United States; I spent a year following migrant farm workers as they were harvesting. I've written about our criminal justice system, and how it treats the victims of crime. I've been working for years now on a book about prisons in America, and I've been going into prisons and traveling around the country and seeing what's going on.\n8294\nYou have to fight for your privacy or you lose it.\n8295\n0\n8296\n0\n8297\n0\n8298\n0\n8299\n0\n8300\n0\n8301\n0\n8302\n0\n8303\n0\n8304\nI challenge you. Be obsessed with improvement!\n8305\n0\n8306\n0\n8307\n0\n8308\n0\n8309\n0\n8310\n0\n8311\n0\n8312\n0\n8313\n0\n8314\n0\n8315\nYoung people never believe in the possibility of their own deaths. That's one reason old men can send them to war.\n8316\n0\n8317\n0\n8318\n0\n8319\n0\n8320\n0\n8321\n0\n8322\n0\n8323\n0\n8324\n0\n8325\n0\n8326\n0\n8327\n0\n8328\nTechnology has made it easier for different firms to coordinate their activities with one another, and they don't have to be part of one company. They can get the benefits of scale without the inertia of scale.\n8329\n0\n8330\n0\n8331\n0\n8332\n0\n8333\n0\n8334\nI like all kinds of music, though I tend to prefer jazz and classics.\n8335\n0\n8336\n0\n8337\n0\n8338\n0\n8339\n0\n8340\n0\n8341\n0\n8342\n0\n8343\n0\n8344\n0\n8345\n0\n8346\n0\n8347\n0\n8348\n0\n8349\n0\n8350\n0\n8351\n0\n8352\n0\n8353\n0\n8354\n0\n8355\n0\n8356\n0\n8357\n0\n8358\n0\n8359\n0\n8360\n0\n8361\n0\n8362\n0\n8363\nI think a lot of women have back problems.\n8364\n0\n8365\n0\n8366\n0\n8367\n0\n8368\n0\n8369\n0\n8370\n0\n8371\n0\n8372\n0\n8373\n0\n8374\n0\n8375\nWhen you aren't working, you really want to emulate the real version of yourself.\n8376\n0\n8377\n0\n8378\n0\n8379\n0\n8380\n0\n8381\n0\n8382\n0\n8383\n0\n8384\n0\n8385\n0\n8386\n0\n8387\n0\n8388\n0\n8389\n0\n8390\nIn arriving at the relevant theory about the specifics of our faculty of vision we will presumably use our eyes to gather relevant data. Based on such data we come to know about the optic nerve, the structure of our eyes, the rods and cones, etc., so as to explain how it is that vision gives us reliable access to the shapes and colors of objects around us. In reliably arriving at that theory we thus exercise the very faculty whose reliability is explained by the theory. There is no vice in this sort of circularity.\n8391\n0\n8392\n0\n8393\n0\n8394\n0\n8395\n0\n8396\n0\n8397\n0\n8398\n0\n8399\n0\n8400\n0\n8401\n0\n8402\n0\n8403\n0\n8404\nYou have to follow your instinct, and that's what I've tried to do all my life, whether in music or anything.\n8405\n0\n8406\n0\n8407\nWhat is it that angers us?... We have been tricked. In essence, we have been lied to. The problem is not that the photograph has been manipulated, but that we have been manipulated by the photograph.\n8408\n0\n8409\n0\n8410\n0\n8411\n0\n8412\n0\n8413\n0\n8414\nWhen you live your life knowing the mission and calling and voice of God in your soul and you know where that compass is driving you forward, you will become a rare commodity in a world searching for direction.\n8415\nOnly those who see themselves as utterly destitute can fully appreciate the grace of God.\n8416\nI'm a complete human being. I'm very emotional and loving. I feel, I hurt, I give, I take, and also I think. I analyze. I'm a sociologist, anthropologist.\n8417\n0\n8418\n0\n8419\nEvery day we make more progress toward understanding the concert hall.\n8420\n0\n8421\n0\n8422\n0\n8423\n0\n8424\n0\n8425\n0\n8426\nThere is an assumption that if you're young and pretty, you will get all these opportunities that are way beyond your musical foundation.\n8427\n0\n8428\n0\n8429\n0\n8430\n0\n8431\n0\n8432\n0\n8433\n0\n8434\nEveryone in my family can sing - my momma can sing, my cousins. I was in the third grade and I was that kid who was so bad in school because I could sing.\n8435\n0\n8436\nI became a real free market fanatic. I'm probably less so now than even two or three years ago.\n8437\n0\n8438\n0\n8439\n0\n8440\n0\n8441\n0\n8442\n0\n8443\n0\n8444\n0\n8445\nHebrew is this unique thing that you cannot translate to any other language. It has to do with its history.\n8446\n0\n8447\n0\n8448\n0\n8449\n0\n8450\nIt is quite rare to find people who are really dedicated to a level of excellence.

The great thing about the Internet is that nobody has to figure out what to do with you. You can figure out what to do with you, and you can say, 'I made this thing, and I'm going to put it out, and now if people want to come see me and buy things from me they can.'\n8469\n0\n8470\n0\n8471\n0\n8472\n0\n8473\n0\n8474\n0\n8475\n0\n8476\n0\n8477\n0\n8478\nLife's too short to wear high heels.\n8479\nActually, I don't really like being confused with my image.\n8480\n0\n8481\n0\n8482\n0\n8483\nYou never date someone's ex-boyfriend. Period. That's not even the unspoken rule - that's the spoken rule.\n8484\n0\n8485\n0\n8486\nI don't cook. I respect food too much.\n8487\n0\n8488\n0\n8489\n0\n8490\nCDs, too. Totally corporate. They look real cheap and soulless and they don't smell of anything.\n8491\n0\n8492\n0\n8493\n0\n8494\n0\n8495\n0\n8496\n0\n8497\n0\n8498\n0\n8499\nActors are a really funny bunch of people, especially the X-Men cast. They're super funny and super nice, and they like to go out and get drinks and dinner and hang out. It's an experience. It's a summer. It's like camp. Everybody gets together and hangs out.\n8500\nThe running joke on set [of the Westworlds] was that everyone at some point thinks that they're Anthony Hopkins. Like, \"Guys, I think I'm Dr. Ford. I'm Anthony Hopkins. That's the twist.\" We love all of the theories. Part of the fun of that show is figuring it out.\n8501\n0\n8502\n0\n8503\n0\n8504\n0\n8505\n0\n8506\n0\n8507\nI lived in a project and...didn't have a good education. But...I'd listen to the preacher, who said that God would show me the way. Everything starts from that confidence.\n8508\nIn your 20s you can be pretty, but you don't accomplish real beauty until you find wisdom and depth.\n8509\n0\n8510\n0\n8511\n0\n8512\n0\n8513\n0\n8514\nI think there are so many children being brought up in some form of violence, be it violence of poverty or sexism or racism or homophobia or transphobia. That violence takes a life to transform or overcome. I don't think people should be spending their lives dealing with that. I think people should be thriving, playing, creating, evolving.\n8515\n0\n8516\n0\n8517\n0\n8518\n0\n8519\n0\n8520\n0\n8521\n0\n8522\n0\n8523\n0\n8524\n0\n8525\n0\n8526\n0\n8527\n0\n8528\n0\n8529\n0\n8530\n0\n8531\n0\n8532\nThere are countries that send us garbage. There are countries that send us their outdated technology as their cooperation. With Fidel [Castro] it is totally different. Fidel is the first and the best one to stand for peace in the world denouncing the interventionist policies of the U.S.\n8533\n0\n8534\nOf course I voted for him. He wasn't a politician; he was a craze.\n8535\n0\n8536\n0\n8537\n0\n8538\n0\n8539\n0\n8540\n0\n8541\nAnyways, trying to express yourself to the press is often like arguing with a hysterical person.\n8542\nI'm from the dirty depths of New Jersey.\n8543\n0\n8544\n0\n8545\n0\n8546\n0\n8547\n0\n8548\n0\n8549\n0\n8550\n0\n8551\n0\n8552\n0\n8553\n0\n8554\n0\n8555\n0\n8556\n0\n8557\n0\n8558\n0\n8559\n0\n8560\n0\n8561\n0\n8562\n0\n8563\n0\n8564\n0\n8565\n0\n8566\n0\n8567\n0\n8568\n0\n8569\n0\n8570\n0\n8571\n0\n8572\n0\n8573\n0\n8574\nReba is very, very close to everyone around her. She's a classy lady.\n8575\n0\n8576\n0\n8577\n0\n8578\nThere's certain things I try to avoid, as an actress, just to keep my world from being as narrow as it could be.\n8579\n0\n8580\n0\n8581\n0\n8582\n0\n8583\n0\n8584\n0\n8585\n0\n8586\n0\n8587\n0\n8588\n0\n8589\n0\n8590\n0\n8591\n0\n8592\nMoney has not changed me.

I drew a line in the calendar and made it a brick wall and just stopped dead. There was no other way. It would've taken another 100 years to slow down slowly. I had to let myself imagine a calendar with no lines; when every single day is being predetermined six months in advance, there's no more fluidity to time.\n8626\nThat's the great thing about incubating something on the web: you have the potential to go to other platforms. Every single platform has a different audience that you find.\n8627\n0\n8628\n0\n8629\nBut since doing the film [\"The Invisible Woman\"] I've really learned to appreciate [Charles Dickens], he's phenomenal. \"Great Expectations\" would be one of my favorites.\n8630\n0\n8631\n0\n8632\n0\n8633\n0\n8634\n0\n8635\nI like to challenge myself.\n8636\n0\n8637\n0\n8638\n0\n8639\n0\n8640\n0\n8641\n0\n8642\n0\n8643\n0\n8644\n0\n8645\n0\n8646\n0\n8647\n0\n8648\nI'm going through an evolution. I'm completely cleaning out my closet. I'm purging, because I saw that show 'Hoarders.' I had a sweatshirt from sixth grade, and I'm going, 'Why do I hold on to this?'\n8649\n0\n8650\n0\n8651\n0\n8652\n0\n8653\n0\n8654\n0\n8655\n0\n8656\n0\n8657\n0\n8658\n0\n8659\n0\n8660\n0\n8661\n0\n8662\n0\n8663\n0\n8664\n0\n8665\nThe live show allows me to transcend myself, because it's not about me anymore. The writing process is very much about me but then the live show is not. They feel really different.\n8666\n0\n8667\n0\n8668\n0\n8669\n0\n8670\n0\n8671\nI don't care about being Fetty Wap. Like, this doesn't mean anything to me. My plan was to make sure that my son would be good, and I have a daughter now, so now she's included into the equation, and the work I do as Fetty Wap made me care.\n8672\n0\n8673\n0\n8674\n0\n8675\n0\n8676\n0\n8677\n0\n8678\n0\n8679\n0\n8680\nI'm a tulip in a cup.

I was literally performing my songs in all kinds of different ways with different guitarists, and I didn't have an album up online or anything. It's been a lot of work; it definitely hasn't been a sudden explosion into fame.\n8700\n0\n8701\n0\n8702\n0\n8703\nWell, my mother and certain other people in my life - a lot of important people - have said, \"Floyd, nobody is perfect except for god.\" And I always knew that; I just wanted my victories to be flawless. I didn't want to get hit at all. I wasn't gonna make any mistakes. And that's the problem with me growing up and being around a trainer that wants his fighter to be perfect.\n8704\n0\n8705\n0\n8706\n0\n8707\n0\n8708\n0\n8709\n0\n8710\nIt's a unique experience when you're doing an independent film where you have one person who puts up all the funds to make the film.\n8711\n0\n8712\n0\n8713\n0\n8714\n0\n8715\n0\n8716\n0\n8717\nWhile clothes with pictures and/or writing on them are not entirely an invention of the modern age, they are an unpleasant indication of the general state of things. ... I mean, be realistic. If people don't want to listen to you, what makes you think they want to hear from your sweater?\n8718\n0\n8719\n0\n8720\n0\n8721\n0\n8722\n0\n8723\n0\n8724\n0\n8725\n0\n8726\n0\n8727\n0\n8728\nFor me hope isn't wishful thinking or blind faith about the future. It's a stance toward life - one of curiosity and humility.\n8729\n0\n8730\nWould I describe myself as new Labour? I'm Labour, organised Labour. I think labels have a limited use and that's where you really get into boy stuff sometimes, just sticking on labels.\n8731\n0\n8732\n0\n8733\n0\n8734\n0\n8735\n0\n8736\n0\n8737\n0\n8738\nHe said, You're so tiny, like a doll, you look like you might break. I wanted him to break me. Part of me did.\n8739\n0\n8740\n0\n8741\n0\n8742\n0\n8743\n0\n8744\nAmericans and their desire to be novelists, the American novel should be listed in medical dictionaries alongside Megalomania and Obsessional Neuroses.\n8745\n0\n8746\n0\n8747\n0\n8748\n0\n8749\nLukewarm people do not live by faith; their lives are structured so they never have to. They don't have to trust God if something unexpected happens- they have their savings account. They don't need God to help them- they have their retirement plan in place. They don't genuinely seek out what life God would have them live- they have life figured and mapped out. They don't depend on God on a daily basis- their refrigerators are full and, for the most part, they are in good health. The truth is, their lives wouldn't look much different if they suddenly stopped believing in God.\n8750\nBy committing the scientific method to religious claims you're committing a logical fallacy\n8751\n0\n8752\nAnyone who's made film and knows about the cinema has a lifelong love affair with the experience. You never stop learning about film.\n8753\n0\n8754\n0\n8755\n0\n8756\n0\n8757\n0\n8758\n0\n8759\nMy love of fashion stemmed from my mother's passion for it.\n8760\n0\n8761\n0\n8762\n0\n8763\n0\n8764\n0\n8765\n0\n8766\n0\n8767\n0\n8768\n0\n8769\n0\n8770\n0\n8771\n0\n8772\n0\n8773\n0\n8774\n0\n8775\n0\n8776\n0\n8777\n0\n8778\nI am the president of the youth of France.\n8779\n0\n8780\n0\n8781\n0\n8782\n0\n8783\n0\n8784\n0\n8785\n0\n8786\nI stole every nickel and blew it on fine threads, luxurious lodgings, fantastic foxes, and other sensual goodies. I partied in every capital in Europe and basked on all the world's most famous beaches.\n8787\n0\n8788\n0\n8789\n0\n8790\n0\n8791\n0\n8792\n0\n8793\n0\n8794\n0\n8795\n0\n8796\n0\n8797\nWe are constantly bemoaning that we have two nominees, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, who are when you put them together as unpopular a duo as we have ever had in our kind of Final Two for the presidency. There are reasons for that, regardless of who ends up winning and going into the White House, I think we need to take dig, those of us in the media, because we're the ones who can foster these discussion and ask the question what is it about the system that got us to a point where most of the people heading to the polls are holding their nose as they cast their vote?\n8798\n0\n8799\n0\n8800\n0\n8801\n0\n8802\n0\n8803\n0\n8804\n0\n8805\n0\n8806\n0\n8807\n0\n8808\n0\n8809\n0\n8810\n0\n8811\nI know I draw without taking my pen off the page. I just keep going, and that my drawings I think of them as scribbles. I don't think they mean anything to anybody except to me, and then at the end of the day, the end of the project, they wheel out these little drawings and they're damn close to what the finished building is and it's the drawing.\n8812\n0\n8813\n0\n8814\n0\n8815\n0\n8816\n0\n8817\n0\n8818\nWe're all gonna land, we don't have rocket packs that last forever. But these things that we love, these things that give us purpose, these moments along the way are our parachutes. So I feel very fortunate to have all of these. Art and my family are pretty much my biggest parachutes.\n8819\n0\n8820\n0\n8821\nMy dad shaped the footballing side of me, and Mum shaped me as a person. I've always been very close to her - we've only ever had one argument, and that was over something stupid when I was 13.\n8822\nMy body of work means nothing to me\n8823\n0\n8824\n0\n8825\n0\n8826\n0\n8827\n0\n8828\nIt's something that people who read my materials have asked me in the past. If you don't have principles - the last chapter of the book [\"Win\"] is all about winning with principles. It's all about applying words to good things, good people, good efforts. Without that inherent accuracy, then even the best words will still fail.\n8829\n0\n8830\n0\n8831\nThe most questionable thing I did was make Superman a government agent. If this had been a Superman story, I'd never have done that - and I know that, because I have a Superman story I want to tell someday. In this story, Batman was the hero, so the world was built around him.\n8832\n0\n8833\n0\n8834\n0\n8835\nThe worse part of being lied to is when you realize you believed it.\n8836\n0\n8837\n0\n8838\n0\n8839\n0\n8840\n0\n8841\n0\n8842\n0\n8843\n0\n8844\n0\n8845\n0\n8846\n0\n8847\n0\n8848\n0\n8849\n0\n8850\nThe way even movements change is stunning: Chinese communist capitalists?

And some artists do it once, twice, three times in their career. He's done it probably a dozen times or more.\n8862\n0\n8863\n0\n8864\n0\n8865\n0\n8866\n0\n8867\n0\n8868\n0\n8869\n0\n8870\nI needed to recognize those secrets I was keeping from myself- secrets I had buried long ago.

You just have to look at England, Italy and Spain, they play right through the season. We on the other hand take six weeks off in the winter until the end of January, and that is a luxury.\n8900\n0\n8901\n0\n8902\n0\n8903\n0\n8904\n0\n8905\n0\n8906\nThat's sort of the idea that if we, in attempting to explain away that which is experienced, the experience itself is diminished.\n8907\nI loooved Sleater-Kinney like a crazy person.\n8908\n0\n8909\n0\n8910\n0\n8911\n0\n8912\nI'm interested in someone who's mired in grief: how do you get back to that thing that makes them warm?

If you do it that way, it makes it more natural and second nature. After awhile you get used to it and there's so much, especially being in New York to film; you're always surrounded by American people.\n8945\n0\n8946\n0\n8947\n0\n8948\n0\n8949\n0\n8950\n0\n8951\n0\n8952\n0\n8953\n0\n8954\n0\n8955\n0\n8956\n0\n8957\nCompassion is sometimes the fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin.

Some people can do it - others can't. If you don't have it, then there's no point in pretending.\n8974\n0\n8975\n0\n8976\n0\n8977\nEverybody comes up with this term lucky-\"Oh, she's so lucky.\" Even though I was lucky, I had a lot of struggle before that. I said I was going to give up everything at age 25 and get into event management because nothing was going for me. I used to have a lot of nervous breakdowns.\n8978\n0\n8979\n0\n8980\n0\n8981\n0\n8982\n0\n8983\n0\n8984\n0\n8985\n0\n8986\n0\n8987\n0\n8988\n0\n8989\n0\n8990\n0\n8991\n0\n8992\n0\n8993\n0\n8994\n0\n8995\n0\n8996\n0\n8997\n0\n8998\n0\n8999\nI don't really think I know myself. I don't quite get how K-pop is functioning. But I'm certain that we need to grab the approval when we have the chance.\n9000\nI always think I'm going to record a lot on tour but it's always hard to fit it in the schedule, and there's a whole lotta' other extra curricular activities that happen on the road.\n9001\n0\n9002\n0\n9003\n0\n9004\n0\n9005\n0\n9006\n0\n9007\n0\n9008\n0\n9009\n0\n9010\n0\n9011\nTo win Olympic gold it takes a lot of HARDWORK, a lot of PASSION, a lot of SACRIFICES.\n9012\n0\n9013\n0\n9014\n0\n9015\nMost people who end up being successful have good grades, but it's orthogonal - there's no extra information than if they put together a website and have bunch of fans who love coming and seeing what they're doing.\n9016\n0\n9017\n0\n9018\n0\n9019\nMy Plan A was to be a psychologist. I thought I would be a receptionist. I'm always middle of the road and very normal. I've always wanted a normal life, and this is what I got.\n9020\n0\n9021\n0\n9022\n0\n9023\n0\n9024\n0\n9025\n0\n9026\nOriginally the big argument was that they wanted to call it \"raw and uncut\" and I told them I had a problem with that. When you say \"raw\" it implies that my show is dirty and that's not the case.\n9027\n0\n9028\n0\n9029\n0\n9030\nFor me as an actor because I've been at it so long, it becomes much harder to watch movies because you really see the seams of everything.\n9031\n0\n9032\n0\n9033\n0\n9034\n0\n9035\n0\n9036\n0\n9037\n0\n9038\n0\n9039\n0\n9040\n0\n9041\n0\n9042\n0\n9043\nI think sometimes when I go to make a move on something, people try to disqualify any talent that I have or any hard work that I've done.\n9044\nI'm competing with everyone, but it's okay because they're not aware. I can't shut that impulse off. And I'm glad, because that impulse keeps me on the treadmill. If I didn't have it, I would be like, \"Great! Ten minutes! I'm good.\" But if I'm competing, I can see what level someone's on and I can top it.\n9045\n0\n9046\nMy heart was a little bit broken, but I still had to go to school. I buttoned my dress shirt over it and my winter coat, too. I hoped it didn't show too much.\n9047\nI dont watch a lot of T.V. I only watch things via Netflix, so I only watch the things that Im choosing to watch.\n9048\n0\n9049\n0\n9050\n0\n9051\n0\n9052\nI think since I was in drama school, I wanted to direct in the theatre. When you are an actor, you just have to open your eyes and you start to learn a lot about how to survive on set and what's important and how to tell a story. Directing is really about putting yourself out there, to be slapped in a way. You know that in the kitchen, you're gonna get burned. It's very scary but very exciting as well. If you have something to say, you have nothing to lose and you probably learn from the experience.\n9053\n0\n9054\n0\n9055\n0\n9056\n0\n9057\n0\n9058\n0\n9059\n0\n9060\n0\n9061\n0\n9062\n0\n9063\n0\n9064\nI don't think the folks in the low-tax states really want to go into a fairness discussion. Residents of Connecticut and New York would love to remind them how much they pay in federal taxes to support programs for Mississippi and South Dakota.\n9065\n0\n9066\n0\n9067\n0\n9068\n0\n9069\n0\n9070\n0\n9071\n0\n9072\n0\n9073\n0\n9074\nTransformation also means looking for ways to stop pushing yourself so hard professionally or inviting so much stress.\n9075\nFind combinations of flavors you love and buy the best quality ingredients you can afford. Your food is only going to be as good as the sum of its parts, like anything else.\n9076\n0\n9077\n0\n9078\n0\n9079\n0\n9080\n0\n9081\n0\n9082\n0\n9083\n0\n9084\n0\n9085\n0\n9086\n0\n9087\n0\n9088\n0\n9089\n0\n9090\n0\n9091\n0\n9092\n0\n9093\n0\n9094\n0\n9095\n0\n9096\n0\n9097\n0\n9098\n0\n9099\n0\n9100\n0\n9101\n0\n9102\n0\n9103\n0\n9104\nKerouac was the cowboy that inspired the whole Beat Generation, and highlighted and put the spotlight on all of these minds that didn't really know what they were doing at the time, but accomplished something much bigger than what they ever foresaw.\n9105\n0\n9106\nIntelligence is like four-wheel drive. It only allows you to get stuck in more remote places.\n9107\n0\n9108\n0\n9109\n0\n9110\n0\n9111\n0\n9112\nChess is life in miniature. Chess is struggle, chess is battles\n9113\n0\n9114\n0\n9115\n0\n9116\nNot only was one cartoonist gunned down, but riots erupted around the world, resulting in the deaths of scores. No one could say toward what positive social end, yet free-speech absolutists were unchastened.\n9117\n0\n9118\nI think in between where you are and where you want to be is a sea of reasons why you can't get there.\n9119\n0\n9120\n0\n9121\n0\n9122\n0\n9123\nIf an action must be taken that will benefit the majority at the cost of the minority, is it morally indefensible? If an action taken for the benefit of a majority occurs at the expense of a minority, is it moral action?\n9124\n0\n9125\n0\n9126\n0\n9127\n0\n9128\n0\n9129\n0\n9130\n0\n9131\n0\n9132\n0\n9133\n0\n9134\n0\n9135\n0\n9136\n0\n9137\nSome people have different ways than yours of having fun. You can't judge 'em, you can't dismiss 'em, and you can't say, 'what an idiot, what a food.' You just have to accept their truth of\ntheir harmony with what they wanna do in their heart. As long as it's not hurting anyone.\n9138\n0\n9139\n0\n9140\nRemember that your ultimate goal is for your children to grow up secure in your love, strong in their faith, and with sound character.\n9141\n0\n9142\nThere's so much music in Austin, and it's all so different.\n9143\n0\n9144\nI love going to concerts, so that whole environment is something that intrigues me anyway.\n9145\n0\n9146\n0\n9147\n0\n9148\n0\n9149\n0\n9150\n0\n9151\n0\n9152\n0\n9153\n0\n9154\n0\n9155\n0\n9156\n0\n9157\n0\n9158\n0\n9159\n0\n9160\n0\n9161\n0\n9162\n0\n9163\n0\n9164\n0\n9165\n0\n9166\n0\n9167\n0\n9168\n0\n9169\n0\n9170\n0\n9171\n0\n9172\n0\n9173\n0\n9174\nIn the '80s the band was 24/7. You were only as good as what you were producing at any given moment. Now my family is more important. I also think having the shock of your mum and dad dying humbles you slightly.\n9175\n0\n9176\n0\n9177\n0\n9178\n0\n9179\n0\n9180\n0\n9181\nI don't know where my ideas come from. I will admit, however, that one key ingredient is caffeine. I get a couple cups of coffee into me and weird things just start to happen.\n9182\n0\n9183\n0\n9184\nWhen I see old photos of me on the beach I don't look too bad... but it's hard trying to breathe in for such a long time when I spot the photographers!\n9185\n0\n9186\n0\n9187\n0\n9188\n0\n9189\n0\n9190\n0\n9191\n0\n9192\n0\n9193\n0\n9194\n0\n9195\nRyan Giggs will go down as the most successful British footballer of all time and I cannot see anyone ever overtaking him. He's on the brink of his 13th league title, after all.\n9196\nI actually have two hats in my office; one says \"network,\" one says \"studio.\" Paul Lee over at ABC sent those over to us and I find it very useful.\n9197\nBeing an actor is a good way to earn a living. And to meet fabulous people. It's great to live very comfortably. I've been lucky, I've had a lot of fun with great roles, but it is true that if I were extremely rich, I would stop and I would go to play football on a beach in the Caribbean with my children.\n9198\n0\n9199\n0\n9200\n0\n9201\nShe was brilliant and joyous and she believed- probably correctly- that libraries contain the answers to all things, to everything, and that if you can't find the information you seek in the library, then such information probably doesn't exist in this or any parallel universe now or ever to be known. She was thoughtful and kind and she always believed the best of everybody. She was, above all else, a master librarian and she knew where to find any book on any subject in the shortest possible time. And she was wonderfully unhinged.\n9202\n0\n9203\nPerhaps the most important thing I can tell you about equipment is to experiment and keep an open mind.\n9204\n0\n9205\n0\n9206\n0\n9207\n0\n9208\n0\n9209\n0\n9210\nBefore my first novel, I was dating a woman who later went to prison for bashing a guy with a hammer.\n9211\n0\n9212\n0\n9213\n0\n9214\n0\n9215\n0\n9216\n0\n9217\n0\n9218\n0\n9219\n0\n9220\nContent is king, but context is God.\n9221\n0\n9222\nI despise 'animal welfare.' That's like saying, 'Let's beat the slaves three times a week instead of five times a week'.\n9223\nThe loving personality seeks not to control, but to nurture, not to dominate, but to empower.\n9224\nThe good thing about forbidding the death penalty is that society won't be able to kill people who are not guilty, but at the same time there are some people that are just such a mental mess that, you know, they will never get out of their obsessions and they can keep them forever.\n9225\n0\n9226\n0\n9227\n0\n9228\n0\n9229\n0\n9230\n0\n9231\n0\n9232\n0\n9233\n0\n9234\n0\n9235\n0\n9236\nI was introduced to country music around a campfire on a farm.\n9237\n0\n9238\nI think a lot of kids do dream in their own way, except 25, 30 years later legend happens because some of us have become quite well known. So the myth becomes magical. So I tend to sort of see it very practical for me. When I go out for a drink, Bono can buy the pints because he has more money than me. We're the same guys, do you know what I mean.\n9239\n0\n9240\n0\n9241\n0\n9242\nHistorically, San Franciscans have not valued street trees as much as other communities have\n9243\nBy just passing through things, I continue to slightly limit myself. I want the jobs that don't say that much. I'm often the stepping stone or the conduit from one thing to another. I love the idea of existing in a film and growing and having bigger arcs, and being in scenes where you're just being, as opposed to talking. That' one of my ambitions, lying ahead.\n9244\n0\n9245\n0\n9246\n0\n9247\n0\n9248\n0\n9249\n0\n9250\n0\n9251\n0\n9252\n0\n9253\nI majored in psychology, and I still love listening to people's problems.\n9254\n0\n9255\n0\n9256\n0\n9257\n0\n9258\n0\n9259\n0\n9260\nIt's partly because our culture so hyper-sexualizes females that if you don't measure up to whatever we're forced to think is the standard, then you feel inadequate.\n9261\n0\n9262\nI'm against the European Union, but I am very much in favor of Europe.\n9263\n0\n9264\n0\n9265\n0\n9266\n0\n9267\nHe [Daniel Craig] is mysterious, and I think that that's the thing Bond has to exude, that kind of mysterious edge. He draws you in, but he is also incredibly cool, you know, James Bond is cool and sharp and Daniel has that to a tee, and he's also got the rawness and an edginess to him that is slightly unhinged, and you're not sure what is going on there, and I think that is really intriguing and interesting. It is a lot weightier and gritty, and he has that.\n9268\n0\n9269\n0\n9270\n0\n9271\n0\n9272\n0\n9273\n0\n9274\n0\n9275\nI went to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, which was in Carnegie Hall, which itself was exciting - just to walk into it.\n9276\n0\n9277\n0\n9278\n0\n9279\n0\n9280\n0\n9281\n0\n9282\n0\n9283\n0\n9284\n0\n9285\n0\n9286\n0\n9287\n0\n9288\n0\n9289\n0\n9290\n0\n9291\n0\n9292\nWomen, you have all this power, I'm telling you. In business, you have something called an inferred fiduciary duty to yourself. Look at the other hugely successful women in industry, commerce, science and everywhere else and you'll see women who are feminine, beautiful but also do not rely on men for their self-empowerment.\n9293\n0\n9294\n0\n9295\n0\n9296\n0\n9297\nI like to eat alone in restaurants, with a book, particularly if I am out of town, alone, on business. It's relaxing. I feel not even a twinge of embarrassment. Is this gender-related? Is there a lingering feeling among women that if they are alone in public, they will be judged to be spinsters or spinsters-to-be?\n9298\n0\n9299\n0\n9300\n0\n9301\n0\n9302\n0\n9303\n0\n9304\n0\n9305\n0\n9306\n0\n9307\n0\n9308\n0\n9309\n0\n9310\n0\n9311\n0\n9312\n0\n9313\n0\n9314\n0\n9315\n0\n9316\n0\n9317\n0\n9318\n0\n9319\nIt's this thing that's going on all the time - aging. Paul Auster quotes the poet George Opren on growing old: \"What a strange thing to happen to a little boy.\" Which I think is so profound.\n9320\n0\n9321\n0\n9322\n0\n9323\n0\n9324\n0\n9325\n0\n9326\n0\n9327\n0\n9328\n0\n9329\n0\n9330\n0\n9331\n0\n9332\n0\n9333\n0\n9334\n0\n9335\n0\n9336\n0\n9337\n0\n9338\n0\n9339\n0\n9340\n0\n9341\n0\n9342\n0\n9343\n0\n9344\n0\n9345\n0\n9346\n0\n9347\n0\n9348\n0\n9349\n0\n9350\nSomeone told me that there's a connection to Superman, that in an early edition of the Green Lantern comics, Tomar Re was the envoy to Krypton. That was fascinating to me.\n9351\n0\n9352\n0\n9353\n0\n9354\n0\n9355\n0\n9356\nYou cannot deny your origins: I love Kirchner more than Matisse, although Matisse was a greater artist. That isn't to do with nationality. It's a stronger feeling.\n9357\n0\n9358\n0\n9359\nAnybody who tunes into Rush Limabaugh already knows what he's going to say and is already inclined to agree.

I saw the Flamingos, the Heartbeats, Jackie Wilson, Chuck Jackson.\n9379\nMy father was and is a great journalist. Thirty years ago, I was studying broadcasting in college, and the problem was I wasn't nearly as good as my father. I wasn't as quick or as smart as my old man, and I realized it would be a long time before I was ever going to be, and I decided to do something else.\n9380\nAs a religious priest I find it a very enriching experience to do my scientific research.\n9381\n0\n9382\n0\n9383\n0\n9384\n0\n9385\n0\n9386\n0\n9387\n0\n9388\n0\n9389\n0\n9390\n0\n9391\n0\n9392\nI want to keep fighting because it's the only thing that keeps me out of the hamburger joints. If I don't fight, I'll eat this planet.\n9393\nThe first thing you have to do is understand what success looks like. And to understand what success looks like you have to understand the intent. If you understand that intent is to make sure the sea lines are secure, then suddenly bombing Kosovo makes sense, because you don't want Serbia to reemerge as a major power.\n9394\n0\n9395\n0\n9396\n0\n9397\n0\n9398\n0\n9399\n0\n9400\nBe strong,be kind,be generous of spirit, be understanding and let people know how grateful you are.Dont get even.Comfort the ones i've hurt and let down.Say your prayers and ask for Gods understanding and strength.Finish with a smile and some gustoand do what's' right and finish strong.\n9401\nI found a movie called “Light in the Piazza.” I finally made the movie with Olivia de Havilland and myself, but initially there was no way I could make that movie, so I went to work on becoming that character. They told me they had an Italian [actor], and I said, “That’s a Cuban boy!” His name was Tomas Milan. I thought that’s the craziest thing I’d ever heard: They have a Cuban who’s going to play an Italian, and I can’t play it because I’m an American.\n9402\n0\n9403\n0\n9404\n0\n9405\n0\n9406\n0\n9407\n0\n9408\nAny marijuana transaction I ever did with anyone, there were never any guns involved, ever.\n9409\n0\n9410\n0\n9411\n0\n9412\nDo we really think that the United States will have the protection of innocent Afghans in mind if it rains terror down on the Afghan infrastructure? We are supposedly fighting them because they immorally killed innocent civilians. That made them evil. If we do the same, are we any less immoral?\n9413\n0\n9414\n0\n9415\n0\n9416\n0\n9417\nAs long as you're a tax deduction, you'll always be safe in my house.\n9418\nThe underlying issues, the psychological motives, in all my movies have been the same, he said. Personal responsibility and friendship, the importance of a compassionate life as opposed to a passionate life.\n9419\n0\n9420\n0\n9421\n0\n9422\n0\n9423\n0\n9424\n0\n9425\n0\n9426\n0\n9427\nOne big theme for me is that we have got to move from an economy built on debt to one where we save and invest in the future.\n9428\n0\n9429\n0\n9430\nCharacter is destiny, and politicians usually get the scandals they deserve, with a sense of inevitability about them.\n9431\n0\n9432\nWe have been actively trying to have New York City host the 2012 Olympics.\n9433\n0\n9434\n0\n9435\nOld stories are like old friends, she used to say.

It’s a reach, really — the artist is trying to inhabit, temporarily, a more compact, distilled, efficient, wittier, more true-seeing, precise version of herself — one that she can’t replicate in so-called ‘real’ life, no matter how hard she tries. That’s why she writes: to try and briefly be more than she truly is.\n9446\n0\n9447\n0\n9448\n0\n9449\n0\n9450\n0\n9451\nI'll tell you what I'd do if it were up to me: I would establish a strictly controlled distribution network through which I would make most drugs, excluding the most dangerous ones like crack, legally available. Initially I would keep the prices low enough to destroy the drug trade. Once that objective was attained I would keep raising the prices, very much like the excise duty on cigarettes, but I would make an exception for registered addicts in order to discourage crime.

Lots of things made the first Mac in 1984 a piece of crap - but it was a revolutionary piece of crap.\n10074\n0\n10075\n0\n10076\nWhen I started making films I just decided \"I'm the filmmaking equivalent of a garage band and I'll just make my garage band movies.\" But even the same musicians from garage bands would go to my movies and you could tell what they liked from the way that they dressed and they would be the first ones to walk out.\n10077\n0\n10078\n0\n10079\nI went through a period where I just wanted to punch everybody. Since then, I've had a lot of therapy and I've figured a lot of things out.\n10080\n0\n10081\nI don't like the idea of agents in a typical form. The idea of agents, to me, brings up the idea of a man in a very boring suit who's not very good looking and doesn't have much attention to style.\n10082\n0\n10083\n0\n10084\n0\n10085\n0\n10086\n0\n10087\n0\n10088\n0\n10089\n0\n10090\n0\n10091\n0\n10092\n0\n10093\n0\n10094\nI want to be a guy, but I want to wear a lot of makeup.\n10095\n0\n10096\nI eat whatever I want.

And just talking about things that really happened. It's just becoming more comfortable as a performer, sharing my opinions on things, or things that've happened to me. That's where it's really going.\n10199\n0\n10200\n0\n10201\n0\n10202\n0\n10203\n0\n10204\nBut I have to add - and this answers your other question - this catholicity in time and in space is only meaningful for me if there is, at the same time, a concentration on the Gospel.\n10205\n0\n10206\n0\n10207\n0\n10208\nTrust me, if you're working on a $70 million movie and you're the last guy, you feel all that weight on your shoulders.\n10209\n0\n10210\n0\n10211\n0\n10212\n0\n10213\n0\n10214\n0\n10215\n0\n10216\n0\n10217\n0\n10218\n0\n10219\n0\n10220\n0\n10221\nI never learned how to tie my shoes, and I was mocked for that.

Is it a man crying out in pain? A woman's scream of terror? A gunshot? A baby crying? And the professor shakes his head and says, 'No, the scariest noise is, you're all alone in your dark house, you know you're all alone, you know that there is no chance anyone else is home or within miles—and then, suddenly, from upstairs, you hear the toilet flush.\n10227\nYou're a writer.

And when he opened his campaign headquarters back in the early '70s, when I was 5 years old, my mother wanted me to play the national anthem.

The current justices have all been chosen from the lower federal courts. A nominee with relevant non-judicial experience would bring a different and useful perspective to the court.\n10283\nI didn't have a lot of independent film connections. It really took until the digital film revolution came along that I realized that I could do it myself.\n10284\n0\n10285\n0\n10286\nI can take critism, but if it's like 'I don't like you' then I want to know why people don't like me.

It's not just purely your own.\n10319\n0\n10320\nI think Brits probably feel that Americans are more like us than vice-versa, if that makes sense. Because we get everything American over here in Britain, but yet there are things which are staunchly English that you guys don't have.\n10321\n0\n10322\n0\n10323\n0\n10324\n0\n10325\nDon't let ignorance blind you.

I will never be jaded with this side of fashion. The catwalk is pure anthropology, something like an esoteric encrypted parade. It can totally be replaced but it will be missed.\n10362\n0\n10363\n0\n10364\n0\n10365\n0\n10366\n0\n10367\n0\n10368\nI feel like looking in the mirror when you brush your teeth, yes, I see lines, and then I smile and I see things here and there.

For example, training in the morning will have everything, all the juices flowing by the time you actually get to work.

I need to be a performer and at the same time the producer. So I need to be somewhere up in the air and producing my music. I can't just be the performer; otherwise I can't see the whole view. I need the big view!\n10544\n0\n10545\n0\n10546\n0\n10547\nI don't love the postmodern statement: \"You shouldn't be spiritual if you are the artist.\"\n10548\n0\n10549\n0\n10550\n0\n10551\n0\n10552\n0\n10553\n0\n10554\n0\n10555\n0\n10556\n0\n10557\n0\n10558\n0\n10559\n0\n10560\n0\n10561\n0\n10562\n0\n10563\n0\n10564\n0\n10565\n0\n10566\nI record at the same place [Toe Rag or FatSounds Studios in London], with the same people [Liam Watson at Toe Rag and Ed Deegan at Fatsounds], every time. It makes it effortless, and another reason for the vast output when I do go in and record stuff.\n10567\n0\n10568\n0\n10569\n0\n10570\nI'm working on producing my own shows. \"Girls Next Door\" was a great place to start but it was somebody else's show. I'm just ready to move on.\n10571\n0\n10572\n0\n10573\n0\n10574\n0\n10575\n0\n10576\n0\n10577\n0\n10578\n0\n10579\n0\n10580\n0\n10581\n0\n10582\n0\n10583\n0\n10584\n0\n10585\nHoodie was just a nickname I had growing up and I just wanted to have a name that would stick in peoples' minds and be a little bit funny and representative of who I am.\n10586\n0\n10587\n0\n10588\n0\n10589\n0\n10590\n0\n10591\nGrowing up, I felt insecure about my build. I didn't feel very feminine. But as time went on, I learned to completely embrace my body.\n10592\n0\n10593\n0\n10594\n0\n10595\n0\n10596\n0\n10597\n0\n10598\n0\n10599\n0\n10600\n0\n10601\n0\n10602\n0\n10603\n0\n10604\n0\n10605\n0\n10606\n0\n10607\n0\n10608\nLuckily, like for instance the song \"Suicide Dream 1,\" I wrote it out of such an incredibly powerful state that the melody carries that affect. So when I produce that affect, that melody, with my body, I'm immediately thrown into it.\n10609\n0\n10610\n0\n10611\n0\n10612\n0\n10613\n0\n10614\n0\n10615\n0\n10616\n0\n10617\n0\n10618\n0\n10619\n0\n10620\n0\n10621\nEvery single American has a voice and ... it ought to be heard in the halls of power every day.\n10622\n0\n10623\n0\n10624\n0\n10625\nWhile we may continue to use the words\nsmart and stupid, and while IQ tests may \npersist for certain purposes, the monopoly\nof those who believe in a single general \nintelligence has come to an end. Brain \nscientists and geneticists are documenting\nthe incredible differentiation of human capacities, computer programmers are creating systems that are intelligent in different ways, and educators are freshly acknowledging that their students have distinctive strengths and weaknesses.\n10626\n0\n10627\n0\n10628\n0\n10629\n0\n10630\n0\n10631\n0\n10632\n0\n10633\n0\n10634\nInexpensive phones and pay-as-you go services are already spreading mobile phone technology to many parts of that world that never had a wired infrastructure.\n10635\n0\n10636\nWhen companies fail, or fail to grow, it's almost always because they don't invest in the people, the systems, and the processes they need.\n10637\nI grew up in repertory theaters, so it was comedy one night, drama the next. I'm used to going from one to the other. And I worked for years in television as well. So, I like the interrelationship of it and having a good relationship with a group of artists creating something really where the sum is greater than all of our individual contributions, our parts.\n10638\nThese nutbags, like Santorum and Bachmann, who make these people and especially young gay kids feel miserable, shame on them. They're quacks. I would never vote for them. I wouldn't even listen to them because there but for the grace of God go they.\n10639\n0\n10640\n0\n10641\n0\n10642\n0\n10643\n0\n10644\n0\n10645\nI don't think it would be crazy to have a model or an entity model on the Reconstruction Finance Corp. That goes back to 1932, although it was really implemented in '33 under Jesse Jones, and it invested in mostly banks initially and preferred stock and that sort of thing.\n10646\n0\n10647\n0\n10648\n0\n10649\n0\n10650\n0\n10651\n0\n10652\n0\n10653\nNow I have new stories and I feel refreshed.

I would be happy to do that.\n10654\n0\n10655\n0\n10656\n0\n10657\nThe formula for a successful film is simple: good script, good direction, a dedicated cast and a fantastic crew.

I was on a talk show with Lou Ferrigno, and I was actually bigger than he was! I went back to the dressing room that night and all of the wrestlers go 'Oh my God you're bigger than the hulk on TV' so they started calling me Terry 'The Hulk' Boulder.\n10694\n0\n10695\n0\n10696\n0\n10697\n0\n10698\n0\n10699\n0\n10700\n0\n10701\n0\n10702\n0\n10703\n0\n10704\n0\n10705\n0\n10706\n0\n10707\n0\n10708\n0\n10709\n0\n10710\n0\n10711\n0\n10712\nMany of the projects I'm most proud of are tall buildings, especially the housing projects. In New York I have two: one in Kips Bay and one at New York University. At that time, those projects were most challenging.\n10713\n0\n10714\nI think that the status that you have in life should be reflected in official documents. If you are married, fine, if you are living with someone, fine, if you are single, fine. We don't want to tell people how to live their lives.\n10715\n0\n10716\n0\n10717\n0\n10718\n0\n10719\n0\n10720\n0\n10721\n0\n10722\nI had a great conversation with Trent Reznor.

The challenge was figuring out how to fit in socially.\n10730\n0\n10731\n0\n10732\n0\n10733\n0\n10734\n0\n10735\n0\n10736\n0\n10737\n0\n10738\n0\n10739\n0\n10740\n0\n10741\n0\n10742\n0\n10743\n0\n10744\n0\n10745\n0\n10746\n0\n10747\n0\n10748\n0\n10749\n0\n10750\n0\n10751\n0\n10752\n0\n10753\n0\n10754\n0\n10755\n0\n10756\n0\n10757\n0\n10758\n0\n10759\n0\n10760\n0\n10761\n0\n10762\n0\n10763\n0\n10764\n0\n10765\n0\n10766\n0\n10767\nPart of the way the work world works is not so much creating a separation between your work and your free time, but creating the illusion of a separation between your work and your free time. Every day is the weekend for me, which means I'm always busy.\n10768\n0\n10769\n0\n10770\n0\n10771\nAnd she did not miss his presence so much as his voice on the phone. Even being lied to constantly, though hardly like love, was sustained attention; he must care about her to fabricate so elaborately and over such a long stretch of time. His deceit was a form of tribute to the importance of their marriage.\n10772\nOn the day after 9/11, I walking through the smoke and the smells of New York. There were knots of policemen everywhere. As I went past one officer, he called out: \"Hi, Magneto.\" That's an indication of X-Men's extraordinary reach.\n10773\n0\n10774\n0\n10775\n0\n10776\n0\n10777\n0\n10778\n0\n10779\n0\n10780\n0\n10781\n0\n10782\n0\n10783\nThe only way I'm going to be able to really, truly live a moment is if it actually means something to me.\n10784\n0\n10785\n0\n10786\n0\n10787\n0\n10788\n0\n10789\n0\n10790\n0\n10791\n0\n10792\n0\n10793\n0\n10794\n0\n10795\n0\n10796\n0\n10797\nI think people, if you really want to be happy, you have to find God yourself, and you're going to have to have a personal, one-on-one relationship and not look to get through these traditions or these rituals and all this crazy stuff when you could talk to him right here, right now, anytime, anywhere, any place, from any position. And that's the kind of relationship you want, not a standard.\n10798\n0\n10799\nI've been pulled out of my nice new car and laid out in the street by the police, interrogated and then have them get in the car and roll off leaving me lying in the street without even saying 'Get up.' The humiliation that they can put on a black man because they determine that you ain't got the money.\n10800\n0\n10801\n0\n10802\n0\n10803\nMy biggest project right now is trying to be a really great mom and learning how to balance family and career. I'm just trying to spend as much time with my family as I can.\n10804\nImagine a film such as Inception with an entire cast of black people - do you think it would be successful? Would people watch it? But no one questions the fact that everyone's white. That's what we have to change.\n10805\nNot every artist is a role model.\n10806\nI'm not the kind of person that likes to be dependent.\n10807\n0\n10808\n0\n10809\n0\n10810\n0\n10811\n0\n10812\n0\n10813\n0\n10814\n0\n10815\n0\n10816\n0\n10817\nWe're big Hillary [Clinton] supporters. For a lot of reasons.\n10818\n0\n10819\n0\n10820\n0\n10821\n0\n10822\n0\n10823\n0\n10824\n0\n10825\n0\n10826\n0\n10827\n0\n10828\n0\n10829\n0\n10830\n0\n10831\n0\n10832\nI think it came out of the fact that I'm a very personal person who lives a very public life. It's the only thing that I thought people would want to hear, and it's never about just being inspirational.\n10833\nI respect them [Amar Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony or Dwyane Wade], but would I dress like them? No.\n10834\n0\n10835\n0\n10836\n0\n10837\n0\n10838\nI jerk off inside books, and give life to words, leaving concepts stuck together you've probably never heard\n10839\n0\n10840\n0\n10841\n0\n10842\n0\n10843\n0\n10844\nMy favorite fall or winter lunch is big steaming bowls of soup. I usually invite people for around 12:30 and have two hearty soups like shrimp corn chowder and lentil sausage soup, which can be made a day or two ahead.\n10845\n0\n10846\n0\n10847\n0\n10848\n0\n10849\n0\n10850\n0\n10851\nThe only thing constant in the world is change, that's why today I take life as it comes.\n10852\n0\n10853\nI pick up the details that drive the organization insane. But sweating the details is more important than anything else\n10854\n0\n10855\n0\n10856\n0\n10857\n0\n10858\n0\n10859\nWe're too passive. We're feeding on too much rubbish and I think we should strive to just shrug away that comfort zone and be able to get the most of each one of us, which means restructuring the way we deal with time and the priorities we have in life, so being what we want to be I think should be something that we should keep in mind.\n10860\n0\n10861\nBeing in a room with other people's energy yields such a different result. I love writing by myself still, but there's something amazing about sharing that experience with someone else.\n10862\n0\n10863\n0\n10864\n0\n10865\n0\n10866\n0\n10867\n0\n10868\n0\n10869\n0\n10870\n0\n10871\n0\n10872\n0\n10873\n0\n10874\n0\n10875\nWe're Jews, my family, and Jews break down into two distinct subcultures: book Jews and money Jews. We were money Jews.\n10876\n0\n10877\n0\n10878\nThe praise helps on a deep level, which gives you the grounding that encourages you to trust yourself. On another level, each film is a risk, and the praise doesn't save you from that risk.\n10879\n0\n10880\n0\n10881\n0\n10882\n0\n10883\n0\n10884\n0\n10885\n0\n10886\n0\n10887\n0\n10888\n0\n10889\n0\n10890\n0\n10891\n0\n10892\n0\n10893\n0\n10894\nI just never want to completely grow up.\n10895\n0\n10896\n0\n10897\n0\n10898\n0\n10899\n0\n10900\n0\n10901\nI'm always watching people over a short time frame, putting them in an extreme position. Sometimes you don't see the humanity in a person because the time frame is so short and the circumstance so extreme.\n10902\n0\n10903\n0\n10904\n0\n10905\n0\n10906\n0\n10907\n0\n10908\n0\n10909\n0\n10910\n0\n10911\n0\n10912\n0\n10913\n0\n10914\n0\n10915\nEvery person is born with a talent, and happiness depends on discovering that talent in time.\n10916\n0\n10917\n0\n10918\n0\n10919\n0\n10920\n0\n10921\n0\n10922\n0\n10923\nAlthough Dorothy in Blue Velvet was humiliated and hurt by men, basically I could react to how she felt.\n10924\n0\n10925\n0\n10926\nSometimes, an actress maybe knows how to think.\n10927\n0\n10928\n0\n10929\n0\n10930\n0\n10931\n0\n10932\n0\n10933\n0\n10934\n0\n10935\n0\n10936\n0\n10937\nI think there are fundamentalists all over the world. I think all religions have fundamentalists who have different interpretations of scriptures that are very vague.\n10938\n0\n10939\nI always try to choose material that I would want to go and see. I don't choose movies anymore to be in that other people wouldn't want to see.\n10940\n0\n10941\n0\n10942\n0\n10943\n0\n10944\n0\n10945\n0\n10946\n0\n10947\n0\n10948\n0\n10949\n0\n10950\n0\n10951\n0\n10952\n0\n10953\n0\n10954\n0\n10955\nEvery person with a disability has a slightly different kind of disability. Not everybody has the same problems. Usually the wheelchairs are the wheelchairs. It's the same height and so on. It's a problem.\n10956\n0\n10957\n0\n10958\n0\n10959\n0\n10960\n0\n10961\n0\n10962\n0\n10963\n0\n10964\n0\n10965\n0\n10966\nI remember when first, Stripes, and then Animal House came out - which I was really proud of, even though it was kind of loose and quite raucous - there were imitative movies that were not quite as good.\n10967\n0\n10968\n0\n10969\n0\n10970\n0\n10971\n0\n10972\nIt's always a huge red flag for me when somebody's reticent or reluctant or a little slow in providing thoughtful references that are a testament to them as a person and their professional accomplishments.\n10973\n0\n10974\n0\n10975\n0\n10976\n0\n10977\n0\n10978\nListen for the instruction, instead of begging for the direction.\n10979\n0\n10980\n0\n10981\n0\n10982\n0\n10983\n0\n10984\n0\n10985\n0\n10986\n0\n10987\n0\n10988\n0\n10989\n0\n10990\n0\n10991\n0\n10992\nYou turn hotdogs with tongs. Don't you ever use those tongs on a hamburger.\n10993\n0\n10994\n0\n10995\n0\n10996\nMy father taught that the only helping hand you're ever going to be able to rely on is the one at the end of your sleeve.\n10997\n0\n10998\nDon't worry, Even Jesus never saw his real father\n10999\n0\n11000\n0\n11001\n0\n11002\n0\n11003\n0\n11004\n0\n11005\n0\n11006\n0\n11007\n0\n11008\n0\n11009\nThe magic that works, to me, is the magic that feels completely grounded and real and tangible.\n11010\n0\n11011\n0\n11012\nNumbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it.\n11013\n0\n11014\n0\n11015\n0\n11016\n0\n11017\n0\n11018\nFor me, there's nothing sexier than a woman who can argue me into the ground and outsmart me...a woman who knows her own mind and isn't afraid to speak it.\n11019\n0\n11020\n0\n11021\n0\n11022\n0\n11023\n0\n11024\n0\n11025\n0\n11026\n0\n11027\n0\n11028\n0\n11029\n0\n11030\n0\n11031\n0\n11032\n0\n11033\nI believe in the human spirit. And usually the people who are following me - my fans and things like that - are like-minded people, in that regard. They like to hear about people being in pain, but that are okay, and people feeling like they can't go on, but then they find a reason to go on. How do you marry someone and love them, and then they die? How does that happen? Why are we on this journey? They want to talk about things, and they want to understand. So, this is the perfect vehicle for that.\n11034\n0\n11035\n0\n11036\n0\n11037\n0\n11038\n0\n11039\nI went through a lot of phases and studied many religions. I am not into religion, I am spiritual.\n11040\n0\n11041\n0\n11042\n0\n11043\n0\n11044\n0\n11045\n0\n11046\n0\n11047\nI can't vote again ever, so political party is not a relevant thing for me.\n11048\n0\n11049\n0\n11050\n0\n11051\n0\n11052\nI really wanted people to pay attention to me and like me. And the class clown thing, you know? There's a weird desperation to the class clown when you really investigate it. Why are they trying to be the clown so much? They're filling some kind of hole.\n11053\n0\n11054\n0\n11055\nRemember, there is no perfect time for anything.

And it comes from striving, maintaining the highest standards, looking after the smallest detail, and going the extra mile. Excellence means doing your very best. In everything!

I do, even though I usually wear trousers, when I put a frock on. I like a bead or a sequin.\n11129\n0\n11130\n0\n11131\nKung fu lives in everything we do.

And, certainly, it comes back to people like armaments makers, and so on and so forth.\n11188\nWe do inherently know that poetry is about the way we speak. It's about where we pause, where we drop our words in the middle of a sentence. It's about the rhythm and the cadence of the way we speak.

Should we be in relationships with individuals who we can not entrust to their own values, integrity, and LOVE...for us??? Here is how I will change my statement...Will and I BOTH can do WHATEVER we want, because we TRUST each other to do so.

I love a great story beyond a great performance. Storytelling is about what we all do together and how we collaborate together. A performance can be a collaboration in ways, but oftentimes it's one individual thing.\n11255\n0\n11256\n0\n11257\n0\n11258\n0\n11259\n0\n11260\n0\n11261\n0\n11262\n0\n11263\n0\n11264\nMy dream career would be to be in things that have real heart and are telling real stories but while doing that, you're getting really big laughs. I don't necessarily love the straight crazy comedies. 'Caddyshack' is amazing, but there's not a lot of new 'Caddyshack's.\n11265\n0\n11266\n0\n11267\n0\n11268\n0\n11269\n0\n11270\n0\n11271\n0\n11272\n0\n11273\n0\n11274\n0\n11275\n0\n11276\nMy songs have always had hope and perseverance in them - I never write songs that have no escape hatch, no positivity.\n11277\n0\n11278\n0\n11279\n0\n11280\n0\n11281\n0\n11282\n0\n11283\n0\n11284\nIn my writing I'm trying to explore the violations people commit upon each other. And the important thing isn't whether I'm angry. The more important thing is, is it true?

A printed poem can be endlessly reprinted, photocopied, scanned, uploaded, cut and pasted - but a performance, even if somebody's there with a video camera, is one time only: the audience experiences something that won't exist when the performance is over, and which won't ever be reproduced in exactly the same form. I find that appealing.\n11303\n0\n11304\n0\n11305\n0\n11306\n0\n11307\nI don't know why I just remembered this, and I haven't told anybody this, but we were shooting in Canyon de Chelly and we were so far up the canyon.

No great accomplishment takes place, whether it be a movie or a deep ocean expedition, or a space mission, without a kind of dynamic equipoise between the two. Luck is not a factor. Hope is not a strategy. Fear is not an option.\n11323\n0\n11324\n0\n11325\n0\n11326\n0\n11327\n0\n11328\nSometimes the right thing gets done for the wrong reason and sometimes, unfortunately, the wrong thing gets done for the right reason.\n11329\nSecretary Hillary Clinton used several different servers and administrators of those servers during her four years at the State Department.

Too bad these things have to be charged or we could get rid of this virus problem in a jiffy.

It's overpopulated. But it is very much home. It was inevitable for me, the moving back. I was living in San Francisco, and Joan broke it off with me, and I needed a place to live. I'd been divorced.

I like reading, other people, not myself.\n11419\n0\n11420\n0\n11421\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone is credited with the credo that a prime minister must be a \"good butcher.\" The metaphor is apt insofar as the root of the word \"decision\" is \"to cut.\"\n11422\n0\n11423\n0\n11424\n0\n11425\n0\n11426\n0\n11427\n0\n11428\n0\n11429\n0\n11430\n0\n11431\nI don't have a computer - I don't like to get into it that much 'cause it can screw with your head a little.\n11432\n0\n11433\nBe the hunter, not the hunted: Never allow your unit to be caught with its guard down.\n11434\n0\n11435\nA cry-wanking scene is the struggle to live, in a single moment.\n11436\nSometimes it seemed like the truth was a bandy-legged soul who dashed from one side of the world to the other and I could never find him.\n11437\n0\n11438\n0\n11439\n0\n11440\n0\n11441\n0\n11442\n0\n11443\n0\n11444\n0\n11445\n0\n11446\n0\n11447\n0\n11448\n0\n11449\n0\n11450\n0\n11451\n0\n11452\n0\n11453\n0\n11454\n0\n11455\n0\n11456\n0\n11457\n0\n11458\n0\n11459\n0\n11460\n0\n11461\n0\n11462\n0\n11463\n0\n11464\n0\n11465\n0\n11466\n0\n11467\n0\n11468\nI'm a very good storyteller; I have a lot of compassion for people. That's very useful for a novelist. A lot of novelists are snots. They're just mean people. I'm not a terribly skilled stylist, nor do I want to be.

I think they look at them.\n11523\n0\n11524\n0\n11525\n0\n11526\nI generally go into a movie with a very strong vision, with how I want to make the film, how I want to shoot the film, how I want to edit the movie, what I want the sound to sound like. So I have a very concrete idea even if I don't storyboard it, I know exactly what I want to do once I get into the sequence. Now having said that, I try not to let that slave me to the process. So if I do storyboard a sequence I don't necessarily stick to it if I discover more exciting things on set.\n11527\n0\n11528\nI never accepted why there should be some invisible, wavy cutoff line separating Great Fiction from phosphorescent beauties and dollhouse miniatures, novels that contain a whole world in a snow globe.\n11529\n0\n11530\nI can definitely tell you what viewers can expect from Season 2 [of 'Zoo']. It picks up right where Season 1 left off - the gang facing this wall of animals charging at a car. And so, it'll be satisfying in that way. The cliffhanger in Season 1 just kind of went to black screen. It picks up right where that left off. And from there on, the stakes just continue to rise in the season, and I think it's really adrenaline-filled.\n11531\n0\n11532\n0\n11533\nWe're gonna release a studio album probably a year from now and we've got these recordings that we did with Coco Taylor and Johnny Johnson, who was Chuck Berry's piano player.\n11534\n0\n11535\n0\n11536\n0\n11537\n0\n11538\n0\n11539\n0\n11540\nI'm no good at the one-liner thing. It's just not me.\n11541\nAs a director, you have a thousand things going on in your head, and of course, that's going to be difficult. That's going to mean that some things get overlooked. And so, for us as performers, being the selfish pricks that we are, we're sitting there being concerned about ourselves all the time and our character's through-line.\n11542\n0\n11543\n0\n11544\n0\n11545\n0\n11546\n0\n11547\nIf business doesn't thrive, it hurts America. We need improved relations, more collaboration, more thought and more consistency as we go about trying to make sure we have the best country in the world. Not scapegoating and finger-pointing.\n11548\nIt's funny when you know you're playing two characters and you're aware of how you have to play each one into your performance of the other. You're constantly at the back of your mind thinking and it all gets a bit confusing.\n11549\n0\n11550\n0\n11551\n0\n11552\n0\n11553\n0\n11554\nYeah, anytime anybody has a kid, you know how you feel when you have a kid, you look at the world differently because your kid's in the world now. When it's just you, whatever happens happens but now you pay more attention to political things. You pay more attention to things because your daughter or your son has to deal with these circumstances.\n11555\n0\n11556\n0\n11557\n0\n11558\n0\n11559\n0\n11560\n0\n11561\n0\n11562\nFrom our point of view, we're just curious, we're poking around and having fun. If it's science, if it's accurate, if it's not accurate, we did the best we can to keep things clean and understandable, but we're just having fun, so sue us if we got something wrong.\n11563\n0\n11564\nI've been going through photos of my mother, looking back on her life and trying to put it into context. Very few people age gracefully enough to be photographed through their aging.\n11565\n0\n11566\nAccessible music is much harder. I could throw out the other kind of albums with my eyes closed. I wouldn't belittle those who want to do the Tricky thing, but it does make me wonder sometimes.\n11567\n0\n11568\n0\n11569\n0\n11570\n0\n11571\n0\n11572\n0\n11573\n0\n11574\n0\n11575\n0\n11576\n0\n11577\n0\n11578\nMy general rule is that if everyone knew how to cook fresh produce from their local area, and Monday to Thursday within 20 minutes, you know, there's millions of recipes out there to be had.\n11579\n0\n11580\nI've worked on the physical side and I think I'm a player that can do most things.\n11581\n0\n11582\n0\n11583\n0\n11584\n0\n11585\n0\n11586\n0\n11587\n0\n11588\n0\n11589\n0\n11590\n0\n11591\n0\n11592\n0\n11593\n0\n11594\nThe Democrats complain; I choose to compete.\n11595\n0\n11596\n0\n11597\n0\n11598\n0\n11599\n0\n11600\n0\n11601\n0\n11602\n0\n11603\n0\n11604\n0\n11605\n0\n11606\n0\n11607\n0\n11608\n0\n11609\n0\n11610\n0\n11611\n0\n11612\n0\n11613\n0\n11614\n0\n11615\n0\n11616\n0\n11617\n0\n11618\n0\n11619\n0\n11620\n0\n11621\n0\n11622\n0\n11623\n0\n11624\n0\n11625\n0\n11626\n0\n11627\n0\n11628\n0\n11629\n0\n11630\n0\n11631\n0\n11632\n0\n11633\n0\n11634\n0\n11635\n0\n11636\nI seem to have been able to make a career out of doing what I feel like doing, so why not keep doing it? What's corrupting is wanting to be more important. You want to be more arty - you get your identity from that. Or you get your identity out of making more money.\n11637\n0\n11638\n0\n11639\n0\n11640\n0\n11641\n0\n11642\n0\n11643\nI think what's happening in the world - there's nothing more dangerous than a wounded beast, and the patriarchy is wounded.\n11644\n0\n11645\n0\n11646\n0\n11647\n0\n11648\nIf only we can overcome cruelty, to human and animal, with love and compassion we shall stand at the threshold of a new era in human moral and spiritual evolution - and realize, at last, our most unique quality: humanity.\n11649\n0\n11650\n0\n11651\n0\n11652\n0\n11653\nLet the vow of this day keep itself wildly and wholly Spoken and silent, surprise you inside your ears Sleeping and waking, unfold itself inside your eyes Let its fierceness and tenderness hold you Let its vastness be undisguised in all your days.\n11654\n0\n11655\n0\n11656\n0\n11657\n0\n11658\nAs an actor, you realize that your whole life is about arrivals and departures. You're always meeting people, you get really close, and then you all have to leave.\n11659\nThere's nothing worse than an anxiety-filled, fearful actor who just needs that next job, because they're not gonna get that next job. Any time I got a job that made me feel good about myself, or made me feel, \"Hey, I'm working my way up,\" then good adds to good. Because it makes you feel better about yourself, and that makes you more attractive, I think.\n11660\n0\n11661\nI'm not a fan of simulations. Where, 'Oh, we'll go play a simulation of world peace and figure out how to make peace' and then somehow magically that will get translated into the real world. No, that's not the kind of games that I make.\n11662\n0\n11663\n0\n11664\nMy guess is that people look at me and project their own values - importance of family, ego is healthy but not the biggest thing.

But at least I have the decency to hate myself. And that's what's missing from the young people. They don't have the debilitating self-loathing and the second guessing.\n11680\n0\n11681\n0\n11682\nLauryn Hill, P-Funk, Marvin Gaye, Public Enemy - I have a very diverse palate for music.

And we have the best innovators, really, in the world. Our international property is one of our huge national economic assets. Yes, so to the extent that some are seeking to infiltrate our network, steal that information, not to have invest in the research and development that goes into innovation, that's a really big deal.\n11707\n0\n11708\n0\n11709\n0\n11710\n0\n11711\n0\n11712\n0\n11713\n0\n11714\n0\n11715\n0\n11716\n0\n11717\n0\n11718\n0\n11719\n0\n11720\n0\n11721\n0\n11722\n0\n11723\n0\n11724\n0\n11725\n0\n11726\n0\n11727\n0\n11728\n0\n11729\n0\n11730\n0\n11731\n0\n11732\n0\n11733\n0\n11734\n0\n11735\n0\n11736\n0\n11737\n0\n11738\n[Steven Spielberg makes] human movies.

Life is a tough thing to begin with, and I like the happy ending.\n11739\n0\n11740\n0\n11741\n0\n11742\nBiology is the science. Evolution is the concept that makes biology unique.\n11743\n0\n11744\n0\n11745\nI like challenges. If you're involved, as one is, in filmmaking, you want to challenge yourself. You don't want to repeat what you're done before.\n11746\n0\n11747\n0\n11748\n0\n11749\nIt's okay to stand on your own two feet and to be different, to be yourself.\n11750\n0\n11751\n0\n11752\n0\n11753\n0\n11754\n0\n11755\n0\n11756\n0\n11757\n0\n11758\n0\n11759\nAll over the world today people have a very strong desire to find a sense of identity, and at the same time that's coupled with the rise of absolutely absurd wars that relate to ethnic identity. Perhaps there is something deeply ingrained in people that relates to a sense of belonging, and without that, identity doesn't seem as real as it should.\n11760\n0\n11761\n0\n11762\n0\n11763\n0\n11764\nThere are some quite funny things about getting famous and stuff, but I think there comes a point where you have to think to yourself, \"Well, am I doing this because I want to go to a party and meet Britney Spears? Or am I doing it because I want to create something that excites me?\"\n11765\n0\n11766\n0\n11767\nI am going to sing lesbian love songs and support gay rights no matter what.

If you have a director that understands that, it's comforting to an actor. You're starting the relationship more as a collaborator, rather than as an employee or some kind of a soldier trying to execute something you don't organically feel.\n11779\n0\n11780\n0\n11781\n0\n11782\n0\n11783\n0\n11784\nA girl came up to me in a bar and said she wanted to be my apple pie.

It's better to be Billy Wilder and make lots of movies and have five or six great ones than to make so few movies that when you make a bad one it crushes you.\n11853\n0\n11854\n0\n11855\n0\n11856\n0\n11857\n0\n11858\nI like being alone and I think this movie, as much as it is an investigation of connection and people bonding, I also think it's just as much about loneliness.\n11859\n0\n11860\n0\n11861\nFozzie Bear has so many bear puns in this script - like, 'Trac is grizzly!' 'This is unbearable!' It's the greatest.\n11862\n0\n11863\nI remember my mentor once said, \"The low road is crowded. The high road is wide open. So let's try to take the high road.\" I think that people are hungry for content that enriches and expires. You can entertain people while still expanding their horizons. You don't have to have it be a race to the bottom with reality television.\n11864\n0\n11865\n0\n11866\nI suppose that's the European way, dangerous and hairy.\n11867\n0\n11868\nI haven't really had too many bosses.

Like an old factory, just something with great bones and lots of character. I'd take an old house and flip it into something very modern inside, or the other way around.\n11880\n0\n11881\nShe wasn't the only one to be physically morphed by reader expectation. Miss Havisham was now elderly whether she liked it or not, and Sherlock Holmes wore a deerstalker and smoked a ridiculously large pipe. The problem wasn't just confined to the classics. Harry Potter was seriously pissed off that he'd have to spend the rest of life looking like Daniel Radcliffe.\n11882\nMy experience with life is that it's very fragmented. In one place certain kinds of thing occur, and in another place a different kind of thing occurs. I would like my work to have some vivid indication of those differences. I guess, in painting, it would amount to different kinds of space being represented in it.\n11883\n0\n11884\n0\n11885\n0\n11886\nI can't imagine what it would be like being James Bond 24 hours.

No... but I will.\n11896\n0\n11897\n0\n11898\nBefore World War II in Canada, you were nobody until you went to England. Then, after that it was you're nobody until you went to the States.\n11899\n0\n11900\n0\n11901\n0\n11902\nWe certainly ... hope that the Congress will act in an appropriate fashion and not waste its time with ineffectual, sham legislation on Keystone XL that has no impact on the price of gas and is irresponsible because it, as we've said before, tries to legislate the approval of a pipeline for which there is not even a route.\n11903\n0\n11904\n0\n11905\n0\n11906\n0\n11907\n0\n11908\n0\n11909\n0\n11910\n0\n11911\n0\n11912\nI do care about the mercury contamination which this country will be experiencing because of the attempted sellout by this administration to special interests which will result in more mercury in the blood of young children in America.\n11913\n0\n11914\nI am a bit old-school.\n11915\n0\n11916\n0\n11917\nResearchers found a frog in new guinea that is so tiny, they believe it's the smallest vertebrate on the planet.

But I find writing is a process of discovery.\n11923\nAfter spending the last 15 years guest hosting, I couldn't be happier to get the opportunity to host my own show! I'm looking forward to talking sports, connecting with listeners, and interviewing amazing guests every day, while being a part of the FOX Sports Radio family. It was worth the wait.\n11924\n0\n11925\n0\n11926\n0\n11927\n0\n11928\n0\n11929\n0\n11930\n0\n11931\nYou could get in rehearsals, pre-production, anything that would actually contribute to the understanding of how a film gets made. I actually find those things increase people's interest in a movie and like that better than worrying about showing the tricks behind the curtain.\n11932\n0\n11933\n0\n11934\n0\n11935\n0\n11936\n0\n11937\nYou watch the Supreme Court in action on these cases, and they are a conflicted court. However, when it comes to speech issues generally, the court has been protective.\n11938\n0\n11939\n0\n11940\n0\n11941\n0\n11942\n0\n11943\n0\n11944\n0\n11945\n0\n11946\nDon't make decisions based on the fear.\n11947\n0\n11948\n0\n11949\n0\n11950\n0\n11951\n0\n11952\n0\n11953\n0\n11954\n0\n11955\n0\n11956\n0\n11957\n0\n11958\n0\n11959\n0\n11960\n0\n11961\n0\n11962\n0\n11963\n0\n11964\n0\n11965\n0\n11966\n0\n11967\n0\n11968\n0\n11969\n0\n11970\n0\n11971\n0\n11972\n0\n11973\nThe Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2005 made it harder for individuals to file bankruptcy, which is always the last resort. Unfortunately, simultaneously consumers racked up so much debt that counseling companies - which are higher up on my list if you need help managing your debt - are sometimes unable to help. So if you fall into this camp, debt settlement may be something to consider.\n11974\n0\n11975\n0\n11976\nI'm happiest on set because I'm not myself. I'm someone else. The moustache, the dinner jacket. It's not me. You're always this sort of double, and it's liberating. Imagine being stuck with yourself... all those doubts.\n11977\n0\n11978\n0\n11979\n0\n11980\n0\n11981\nWhat happens is that you discover you're carrying so much weight that 90 percent of what you thought yesterday you are thinking about today and will think about again tomorrow. Your mind doesn't change because you are carrying too large a load. So the mind is caught. It's seized by its own structures. It can't consider different ways of thinking or doing or being or relating. It's all you can do with your psychic energy to keep pulling yourself along with this huge bag that you are dragging behind you.\n11982\n0\n11983\n0\n11984\n0\n11985\n0\n11986\n0\n11987\n0\n11988\n0\n11989\n0\n11990\n0\n11991\n0\n11992\n0\n11993\n0\n11994\nClothes are expensive.

It's terrible. When you have a band of guys on the battlefield, if someone is dead, he's dead. If someone is injured then they have to take care of him, so six people are busy.\n12038\n0\n12039\n0\n12040\n0\n12041\n0\n12042\n0\n12043\n0\n12044\nNaked I came into the world, but brush strokes cover me, language raises me, music rhythms me. Art is my rod and staff, my resting place and shield, and not mine only, for art leaves nobody out. Even those from whom art has been stolen away by tyranny, by poverty, begin to make it again. If the arts did not exist, at every moment, someone would begin to create them, in song, out of dust and mud, and although the artifacts might be destroyed, the energy that creates them is not destroyed.\n12045\n0\n12046\n0\n12047\n0\n12048\n0\n12049\n0\n12050\n0\n12051\n0\n12052\n0\n12053\n0\n12054\nI just think people, when they get elected, they ought to serve.

It's excruciating... I mean, it's the worst thing 'cause it's not... It never... It does go away - it's not true to say that it doesn't but, uhh... It doesn't... The doctors say it won't... It isn't actually going away - you've just gotta suppress... They try to come to terms with what it actually... Why some people fear it - that's the psychology behind it. They know it's there but why is it such a horrible sound? Well, you can say why is a guy scratching at a window with his nails such a horrible sound - I couldn't put up with that! This is worse!\n12071\n0\n12072\n0\n12073\nOne of the things that gets me up in the morning is knowing that customer expectations are always rising, and I find that very exciting.\n12074\n0\n12075\n0\n12076\n0\n12077\n0\n12078\nWe would do improvisation together. And that in a way, had almost a \"student-film side\" where we'd be sitting there with Robert Downey and Jon Favreau and we're playing around, we're jamming around and we read those pages and in next couple of days that's what we do, so it was a good experience. Kind of frightening at first because you didn't quite know how it was going to work out, but they had some very talented people there so it worked out well.\n12079\n0\n12080\n0\n12081\n0\n12082\n0\n12083\n0\n12084\n0\n12085\n0\n12086\n0\n12087\n0\n12088\nI think the hardest part about my job is the best part of my job - the travel.\n12089\n0\n12090\n0\n12091\nThere are so many projects that you go into hoping the story works, and here comes a new third act and that kind of thing.\n12092\n0\n12093\nMost people when they have autobiographies, they're not autobiographies, they're biographies written by a ghost writer.\n12094\n0\n12095\n0\n12096\n0\n12097\n0\n12098\nPresident Trump and his administration are right to be concerned about national security, but it's unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry.\n12099\n0\n12100\nLadies have come up with all these expressions to reassure men. \"Oh, honey, it's not the size of the ship, it's the motion of the ocean.\" That may be true, but it takes a long time to get to England in a rowboat.\n12101\n0\n12102\n0\n12103\nI'm not sure when the New Media will replace the Old Media, but it will be sooner than later.\n12104\n0\n12105\n0\n12106\nIt's a delight to trust somebody so completely.\n12107\n0\n12108\n0\n12109\n0\n12110\n0\n12111\n0\n12112\nDevelop a depression.\n12113\n0\n12114\n0\n12115\n0\n12116\n0\n12117\n0\n12118\n0\n12119\n0\n12120\n0\n12121\nArt has this ability to allow you to connect back through history in the same way that biology does.

I have to work twice as hard to make sure I don't just check out. That's what I mean by vulnerability.\n12235\n0\n12236\n0\n12237\n0\n12238\nI love talking about movies that mean something to me.\n12239\n0\n12240\n0\n12241\nI had not starred in an independent film and it's about a woman who owned a hair salon.\n12242\nI think it would be exhausting and depressing, to write, to watch and to live, if it was just focused on drama. It's heavy. Also, I think the humor really highlights the pathos and the struggle. You can slam it up against drama, and it makes both shine.\n12243\n0\n12244\n0\n12245\n0\n12246\n0\n12247\nI hope to continue writing. I hope to continue teaching.\n12248\n0\n12249\nMusic videos are notoriously long, not fun, grueling. You are known there as a dancer and it's kind of sad because dancers, in a lot of ways, are under-appreciated and kind of under-respected when it come to that so they don't necessarily treat you in a nice way when you do a music video.\n12250\n0\n12251\nI'm a very thoughtful, forward-thinking, planner kind of person. I love Excel spreadsheets and five-year-plans, and I love to review every year how my New Year's resolutions went.\n12252\n0\n12253\n0\n12254\n0\n12255\n0\n12256\n0\n12257\n0\n12258\n0\n12259\n0\n12260\n0\n12261\n0\n12262\n0\n12263\n0\n12264\n0\n12265\nYou have been doing something that has brought you success, and you are in the playoffs because you have been doing some thing right.\n12266\n0\n12267\n0\n12268\n0\n12269\n0\n12270\nAs women, we do feel like we have to live up to an expectation, whether it's on camera or going to the market or whatever it is. And the truth of the matter is, that's not always the way it is. We don't always have our high heels on, we don't always have our makeup on.\n12271\n0\n12272\n0\n12273\n0\n12274\nI think science and spirituality are one and the same, I don't think they're really different. The film makes pretty clear that quantum physics is validating all kinds of spiritual teachings.\n12275\n0\n12276\n0\n12277\n0\n12278\n0\n12279\n0\n12280\nI do finish reading a script and say, Why are they making it and what are they talking about? I like to try and be responsible in my choices in that way.\n12281\nWhen you're an actress, there are only a few times you can really get paid. One of them is doing a sequel. They can't fake you or hire another actor to play you.\n12282\n0\n12283\n0\n12284\n0\n12285\n0\n12286\nSure, everything is ending,\" Jules said, \"but not yet.\n12287\n0\n12288\n0\n12289\n0\n12290\n0\n12291\n0\n12292\nI don't have this fantasy about marriage anymore. Everyone says it takes hard work. Well, it kind of does -- and I'm much more pragmatic about romance than I used to be. [With Scott] I wanted to see him as a white knight and was crushed whenever anything normal happened. I wanted to be the princess. Now I'm much more willing to see myself as human and flawed, and accept someone -- the whole picture. My life is definitely changing for the better. I couldn't be happier or feel more comfortable with the direction it's going in.\n12293\nThe question is what will Mitt Romney do as president if his policy is simply to be hands off and let the government be made so small it can be drowned in a bathtub. In the 21st century global economy, no state alone has the ability to compete against China.\n12294\n0\n12295\n0\n12296\n0\n12297\nI have a serious love for clothes, like no other.\n12298\n0\n12299\nI'm a typical middle child. I'm the mediator. The one that makes everything OK, puts their own needs aside to make sure everybody's happy. It's hard to change your nature, even with years and years of therapy.\n12300\n0\n12301\nI've never considered failure.\n12302\nYou have to stand up and say, 'There's nothing wrong with me or my shape or who I am; you're the one with the problem!'\n12303\nI'd never watch a horror film, but after I found out I was going to be in one, I watched, like, four of them, including The Shining, I was terrified - I couldn't sleep for days. But I wanted to get myself used to things I was going to see on the set.\n12304\nFor me, one of the most important things I look for in an actor is whether we can converse. Do we have a similar ability to discuss a character?\n12305\n0\n12306\n0\n12307\n0\n12308\n0\n12309\n0\n12310\n0\n12311\n0\n12312\n0\n12313\n0\n12314\n0\n12315\n0\n12316\n0\n12317\n0\n12318\n0\n12319\n0\n12320\n0\n12321\n0\n12322\n0\n12323\n0\n12324\n0\n12325\n0\n12326\nI hope that's what I've taught my girls - to be fair, to recognize their own position and their own good fortune, to use their voices to make things better. Beyond that, I'd tell them just to be kind.\n12327\n0\n12328\n0\n12329\n0\n12330\n0\n12331\n0\n12332\n0\n12333\nWe actually tried to put in [Kung Fu Panda 3] all the things we wanted to put into the first two films. We're all the same people who've been working on the other films and we all had things we couldn't do, and had to leave on the table. We just couldn't achieve them before. This time we have multiple new environments and different styles of animation.\n12334\n0\n12335\n0\n12336\n0\n12337\n0\n12338\nBeing alone with yourself is increasingly unpopular.\n12339\nI've always been a fan of reading art catalogues from exhibitions, and plays, and I've worked with a surrealist German playwright, Heiner Müller.\n12340\n0\n12341\n0\n12342\n0\n12343\n0\n12344\n0\n12345\n0\n12346\n0\n12347\n0\n12348\n0\n12349\n0\n12350\n0\n12351\n0\n12352\nI don't like feeling hemmed in and I don't like feeling that I'm repeating myself.\n12353\n0\n12354\n0\n12355\nI didn't have a home in the world, so I wanted a home in a person. I felt like I had found that, and then it was taken away from me.\n12356\n0\n12357\nWhat NATO troops are doing in Afghanistan is to train, assist and advise Afghans, but they are actually doing the fighting. They are actually taking the responsibility for the security in their own country. And that is a great achievement, compared to what we saw just a few years ago, when NATO troops had to conduct the combat operations fighting the Taliban.\n12358\n0\n12359\n0\n12360\n0\n12361\n0\n12362\n0\n12363\n0\n12364\n0\n12365\n0\n12366\nWhile we do have 50 years of terrific Avengers stories, many of which our writing staff has written, along the way, this has to live in its own world.\n12367\n0\n12368\n0\n12369\nBarack Obama's a politician, I'm a pastor. We speak to two different audiences.\n12370\n0\n12371\n0\n12372\n0\n12373\n0\n12374\n0\n12375\n0\n12376\n0\n12377\nAsking the front wheels of a car to do their normal job of steering while handling more than 170 is like asking a man to wire a plug while juggling. Penguins. While making love. To a beautiful woman while on fire, on stage. In front of the Queen. It's all going to go wrong.\n12378\nWhen legal aid was first introduced in 1949, the late Arthur Skeffington said that the law at that time was like The Ritz, in that those who could afford to pay had access to it, while those who could not did not.\n12379\n0\n12380\n0\n12381\n0\n12382\n0\n12383\n0\n12384\n0\n12385\n0\n12386\n0\n12387\n0\n12388\n0\n12389\n0\n12390\n0\n12391\n0\n12392\nThe fact is that in England so many of our politicians are career politicians - they've always been politicians since they left their education. And in the old days of course politicians used to be fish mongers or doctors or whatever. They'd lived life. These days, power seems to go to the hands of people that that's all they've done. And I'm not sure that's a good thing, because it does remove them from the realities of life.\n12393\nThere's nothing nicer than coming back to your village, where people like my mum's friends take the mick out of me. I prefer that to the craziness of Hollywood.\n12394\n0\n12395\n0\n12396\n0\n12397\n0\n12398\n0\n12399\n0\n12400\n0\n12401\n0\n12402\n0\n12403\n0\n12404\n0\n12405\n0\n12406\nI come from a theater family and a theater background, and I come from a philosophy that you respect the space you occupy when you work and you put everything that you have into something.\n12407\n0\n12408\nI will never be in the stock market. It's just gambling. I'm a gambler, but I'll gamble on the practicality of things.\n12409\n0\n12410\nt century, hundreds of millions - and eventually billions - of human beings will transform their buildings into power plants to harvest renewable energies on site, store those energies in the form of hydrogen and share electricity, peer-to-peer, across local, regional, national and continental inter-grids that act much like the Internet.\n12411\n0\n12412\n0\n12413\n0\n12414\n0\n12415\n0\n12416\n0\n12417\n0\n12418\n0\n12419\nI'm married now, but back when I had girlfriends, you were always wondering if they liked you, and if you liked them enough.

I love that he created a turning point in visual history, that he redefined the idea of beauty, that he combined painting, sculpture, photography, and everyday life with such gall, and that he was interested in, as he put it, 'the ability to conceive failure as progress.'\n12497\n0\n12498\n0\n12499\n0\n12500\n0\n12501\nSomebody just gave me a shower radio.

If they can conceive it and believe it, they can achieve it. They must know it is not their aptitude but their attitude that will determine their altitude.\n12536\n0\n12537\n0\n12538\n0\n12539\n0\n12540\n0\n12541\nI definitely caught a lot of backlash in my situation, not just from students but also from faculty, which was unfortunate, given that I was spending a lot of my time outside school working on a career, which a lot of people didn't really agree with.\n12542\n0\n12543\n0\n12544\n0\n12545\n0\n12546\n0\n12547\n0\n12548\n0\n12549\n0\n12550\n0\n12551\nI will not be a Democrat or a Republican.

Things that are written about it are all crap.\n12558\n0\n12559\n0\n12560\nI just want an opportunity. If you don’t like the audition, don’t hire me! But if you don’t want to even see me - that’s hurtful. And why? You know nothing about me!\n12561\n0\n12562\nI trained as a ballet dancer - well, I started when I was two and a half, and was serious about it from when I was eight until I was 18.\n12563\n0\n12564\nAn actress friend of mine shared a great trick. She told me to stick my tongue behind my teeth when I smile to keep from over-smiling. If you smile without doing it, sometimes your gums show a little too much. It's an actor's trick!\n12565\n0\n12566\n0\n12567\n0\n12568\n0\n12569\n0\n12570\n0\n12571\n0\n12572\n0\n12573\n0\n12574\n0\n12575\n0\n12576\n0\n12577\nAs an actor, you have to have trust and believe that somebody is taking care of you or watching your back. With a part like this, especially with where we're going with it, I can't pull any punches. I can't do it halfway, especially when you're dealing with madness and this descent into madness.\n12578\n0\n12579\n0\n12580\n0\n12581\n0\n12582\n0\n12583\n0\n12584\n0\n12585\n0\n12586\nThe music industry is rolling in cash...\n12587\n0\n12588\n0\n12589\n0\n12590\n0\n12591\nI'm trying to create a relationship with myself.

I went to sports school when I was 8. So I studied martial arts.\n12616\n0\n12617\n0\n12618\nReality is what you believe it to be. It's what you put your thought and energy into, because your hands physically manifest thought. So your world becomes what you feel and what you think.\n12619\n0\n12620\nNothing really came, everything was like inspired by something.\n12621\n0\n12622\n0\n12623\n0\n12624\n0\n12625\n0\n12626\n0\n12627\n0\n12628\n0\n12629\n0\n12630\nI think the Huffington Post has been inventive and presents what it aggregates well.\n12631\n0\n12632\n0\n12633\n0\n12634\n0\n12635\n0\n12636\n0\n12637\n0\n12638\n0\n12639\n0\n12640\n0\n12641\n0\n12642\n0\n12643\n0\n12644\n0\n12645\n0\n12646\n0\n12647\n0\n12648\nI don't necessarily think of myself as a feminist, but I'm a whole person. I'm not just breasts or ass or thighs - I'm a whole being! And it just seems like women aren't necessarily striving to be the whole of themselves.\n12649\nMy original idea- and I still want to do it -for Pinko Records, would be to create a platform for other artists to do the same thing I did. They could create their own levels of donation and final goal. I have no idea how I would make any money on that -but I don't think like that.\n12650\nIt's really just a freedom that we have with Amazon to push ourselves creatively. It allowed me to say, you know, okay this is going to be a little half-hour film here to start the season.\n12651\n0\n12652\nThe Keystone pipeline will spew a massive amount of carbon pollution into our fragile atmosphere.

I'm making my own box. There's no way I would be able to make the music I'm making without dancing.\n12661\n0\n12662\nDon't shut down your emotions. Embrace them. Your emotions are your internal compass telling you whether or not you are on track. Use them to help cultivate your passions or motivate you to change situations and circumstances that hold you back from achieving your goals.\n12663\n0\n12664\n0\n12665\n0\n12666\nWhat's cool about baseball is you don't have to see someone for years, but when you see them, you just hustle up and give them a big hug.

When all the pressure rides on your shoulders, it can be a lot different. Team sports you share those moments with the teammates. You share the pressures. You share the wins. You share the losses. You have a coach that can change the course of matches. But in tennis you're out there by yourself. There are no caddies. There are no coaches. You do it alone in the arena and I think that ups the ante a little bit.\n12710\n0\n12711\n0\n12712\n0\n12713\n0\n12714\n0\n12715\n0\n12716\n0\n12717\n0\n12718\n0\n12719\n0\n12720\n0\n12721\n0\n12722\n0\n12723\n0\n12724\n0\n12725\n0\n12726\n0\n12727\n0\n12728\n0\n12729\n0\n12730\n0\n12731\nNow don't get me wrong, I love animals, but I like eatin' 'em more... fun to pet, better to chew.\n12732\n0\n12733\n0\n12734\n0\n12735\n0\n12736\nThere were people whom I considered friends or loved ones who either abandoned me or betrayed me in ways I'd never have suspected. But there were others who had been barely acquaintances of mine whose loyalty and efforts on my behalf made me realize that not everyone was as inherently rotten as I'd previously believed. So it caused a violent split in my view of humanity - people turned out to be far worse and far better than I'd ever dreamed possible.\n12737\n0\n12738\n0\n12739\n0\n12740\nYou're kind of numb after 50 shots to the head.\n12741\n0\n12742\nThe corporation cannot be ethical, its only responsibility is to make a profit.\n12743\n0\n12744\n0\n12745\n0\n12746\n0\n12747\n0\n12748\nGod forbid Donald Trump gets elected president; think about how many people are going to get f**ked over or how much harder we're going to have to fight for equality.\n12749\nI like repetition, but I really, really like variations, synchronistic things that happen where you're not really thinking about them.\n12750\nCan't punch women in the face!\n12751\n0\n12752\n0\n12753\n0\n12754\n0\n12755\n0\n12756\n0\n12757\n0\n12758\n0\n12759\n0\n12760\n0\n12761\n0\n12762\nI started as a print reporter. I’m a journalist and that’s what I do. My function is an anchorperson, but it’s in a journalism context, and gravitas and coats and ties and haircuts and all that sort of stuff, I’ll leave to others. My thing is just to do my job the best way I know how and as I say I’m very fortunate to be able to do it the way I want to do it.\n12763\n0\n12764\n0\n12765\n0\n12766\n0\n12767\n0\n12768\n0\n12769\n0\n12770\n0\n12771\n0\n12772\n0\n12773\n0\n12774\n0\n12775\n0\n12776\n0\n12777\n0\n12778\n0\n12779\n0\n12780\n0\n12781\n0\n12782\nI don't pull out because... it's not my problem.\n12783\n0\n12784\n0\n12785\n0\n12786\n0\n12787\n0\n12788\n0\n12789\nYou can look at the Emmys two ways in you're nominated. It's either win-win or lose-lose. If things go very well and I win, you still have to get up in front of a group of people and risk having God knows what come out of your mouth. If you won't win, you have to breathe deeply and smile and clap with a camera in your face.\n12790\n0\n12791\n0\n12792\n0\n12793\n0\n12794\n0\n12795\n0\n12796\n0\n12797\n0\n12798\n0\n12799\nNice to see Christian return as he's been on the injured list for months. 'Captain Charisma' is due to have a big 2011. Very skilled, underrated talent.\n12800\n0\n12801\n0\n12802\n0\n12803\nI believe it is essential to have English as the official language of our National Government, for the English language is the tie that binds the millions of immigrants who come to America from divergent backgrounds. We should, and do, encourage immigrants to maintain and share their traditions, customs and religions, but the use of English is essential for immigrants and their children to participate fully in American society and achieve the American dream.\n12804\n0\n12805\nI'm tempted to do everything. And sometimes I think, \"Oh, come on.

Desmond Tutu did that in South Africa. Martin Luther King Jr. did that here. This is a good thing.\n12826\n0\n12827\n0\n12828\n0\n12829\n0\n12830\n0\n12831\nThe books that I do, the stories I write - I'm glad I'm able to do them, but they will quickly be swallowed up by the sands of time. Sometimes it frustrates me that I'm not able to do bigger, more important, more significant things. I guess you have to be content to do whatever it is you can do.\n12832\n0\n12833\n0\n12834\n0\n12835\n0\n12836\n0\n12837\n0\n12838\n0\n12839\nlater down the road of life, i made the discovery that salt water was also good for the mental abrasions one inevitably acquires on land.\n12840\n0\n12841\nWherever life takes us, there are always moments of wonder.\n12842\n0\n12843\nI have not become the artist I believe I am. I want to become a stadium act. I'm not done at all.\n12844\nThat's something a lot of athletes miss - a lot of them walk away too soon. They don't get everything out of their system. They have a lot of what-ifs when they're sitting around later in life. I don't have that. I got all that out of my system. I pushed it to the brink, I loved it, and when I walked away, I'd had enough.\n12845\n0\n12846\nA recent study shows that standing at work for long periods of time is bad for you, after earlier research indicated that sitting for too long at work is bad for you. So really the only thing we know is, work is bad for you.\n12847\n0\n12848\n0\n12849\n0\n12850\n0\n12851\n0\n12852\n0\n12853\n0\n12854\n0\n12855\n0\n12856\n0\n12857\nYou absorb so much from whatever your environment is, as an artist, and you learn to take from it what can help you create.\n12858\n0\n12859\n0\n12860\n0\n12861\n0\n12862\n0\n12863\n0\n12864\n0\n12865\n0\n12866\n0\n12867\n0\n12868\n0\n12869\nLove.

That is very ambitious - to say something about the human condition that hasn't been written before. Probably I will never succeed but that is what I strive to do.\n12891\n0\n12892\n0\n12893\n0\n12894\n0\n12895\n0\n12896\n0\n12897\n0\n12898\n0\n12899\n0\n12900\n0\n12901\nThere's a consensus out that it's OK to kill when your government decides who to kill.

Acting was unimaginable to my parents.\n12907\n0\n12908\nGone are the days when a gentleman lightly took your hand in his and brushed his lips across it, or tipped his hat to acknowledge you as he chivalrously stepped aside to let you pass.\n12909\n0\n12910\nI'm interested in acting roles that I want to do, that are meaningful to me in some way. I think, because my kids are still pretty young, if something is meaningful and it's a good little part that I could do or feel that I can have fun with, then I'm interested in it. I'd like to be able to do a TV show or something and really have a voice in it.\n12911\n0\n12912\nGrammar is a piano I play by ear.\n12913\n0\n12914\n0\n12915\nYou gotta not care about what people think in general about you. I'm not talking about bad stuff, if you're a nasty person, because I don't consider myself a mean person, I consider that I know what i want and I'm tough. But I'm very emotional and un-tough on a lot of levels, I cry very easily, I'm sensitive and I don't think that's a bad thing.\n12916\n0\n12917\n0\n12918\nBeing an artist is not exactly the most universally respected, or secure thing to do with your life. It can be frightening and you can feel that you're taking a lot of risks just with your own life, and your family's security.

I enjoy kicking back on a good night and drinking wine until I go to bed, and having fun with my friends.

When you hit mainstream, you hit a saturation level and that turns some people off. When you are on more low-key stuff, it works to your advantage and it creates a buzz on the streets.

I love any genre of music, and I think it's really great to see that there are new artists coming through. It's kinda funny to think that I'm like the old man on campus now.

I stand before you today as a witness to the goodness of God.

You're feeling gun shots. I mean, it's not the way people say it is, but the gunshot sounds real. And cars sound real. Among the many things in the evolution (of movies) is to make the sound in the movie incredible.

I think they chose to leave based on the fact that they felt a reprisal for being associated or having a friendship with John Carlos or Tommie Smith, or Peter Norman, for that matter.\n13287\n0\n13288\n0\n13289\nAnybody can make a movie, if you have the will.

Equally important, stories are something we share - everyone everywhere tells stories and oddly enough, in the same way.

So let's say if the Tron sequel comes out later, then four or five years have passed since the last movie.\n14071\n0\n14072\n0\n14073\n0\n14074\n0\n14075\n0\n14076\n0\n14077\n0\n14078\nSometimes you do things for personal reasons. I made a very personal movie in We Are Marshall. I was afraid of flying, for a long time, and that's a movie about a plane crash.\n14079\n0\n14080\n0\n14081\n0\n14082\n0\n14083\n0\n14084\n0\n14085\n0\n14086\n0\n14087\n0\n14088\n0\n14089\n0\n14090\n0\n14091\n0\n14092\n0\n14093\n0\n14094\n0\n14095\nI knew that discrimination existed, even though there were many individuals who were not prejudiced.\n14096\n0\n14097\n0\n14098\n0\n14099\n0\n14100\n0\n14101\n0\n14102\n0\n14103\n0\n14104\n0\n14105\n'W.' is not necessarily a political film, but it was sort of a contrasting reality for me to get into George W. Bush as a character because of how I felt about his administration before I started making the film.\n14106\n0\n14107\n0\n14108\n0\n14109\nFinally, you get the job, and you think you'll be dancing on the ceiling, but I just wanted to go take a nap. It was just like a weight had been lifted off or something.\n14110\nThere are a lot of people who are eager to assign blame. I think we're [USA] eager to try and find some solutions. One thing that would help would be comprehensive immigration reform legislation.\n14111\n0\n14112\n0\n14113\nOne of my top 10 favorite movies of all time was South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. Team America is a work of genius to me.\n14114\n0\n14115\n0\n14116\n0\n14117\nI still like to keep all the love songs for the Grobanites, I like to make sure that they know those are just for them.\n14118\nIt's not scary to make a horror film because you get to pull back the curtain and see that none of it's real. When you're watching one, the terror bombards you.\n14119\n0\n14120\n0\n14121\n0\n14122\n0\n14123\n0\n14124\n0\n14125\nI never really read a character before that I connected with more than Peeta. So, for me, if I couldn't get that job I was like, 'Well, if I can't play practically myself in a movie, what can I play?\n14126\n0\n14127\n0\n14128\n0\n14129\n0\n14130\n0\n14131\n0\n14132\n0\n14133\n0\n14134\nCuriosity is a key building block. The more curious you are, the more creativity you will unleash. A great way to do that is to ask the three \"magic questions\" again and again... those questions are simply, \"Why\", \"What if?\", and \"Why not?\". Asking these questions constantly focused you on the possibilities and away from how things are at the moment.\n14135\nNew York has got this sort of wonderful romantic idea of the South\n14136\n0\n14137\n0\n14138\n0\n14139\n0\n14140\n0\n14141\nLove can wait to give; it is lust that can't wait to get.\n14142\nJust to be part of a process where you hit no professional speed bumps and you're just sort of going on and on. I'm surrounded by these people that are all so collaborative and all bring things of their own to the process. For them to be alive in the scenes so you don't have to worry.\n14143\n0\n14144\n0\n14145\nTalk about what you love and keep quiet about what you don't.\n14146\n0\n14147\n0\n14148\n0\n14149\n0\n14150\n0\n14151\n0\n14152\n0\n14153\n0\n14154\n0\n14155\n0\n14156\n0\n14157\n0\n14158\nWhat drew me to the violin was mastering the instrument technically, which I'm continuing to do.\n14159\n0\n14160\n0\n14161\n0\n14162\n0\n14163\nWhy shouldn't it be that way for the rest of us? Why not just go with it? Just walk the dog and send the tweets and eat the scones and play with the hamsters and ride the bicycles and watch the sunsets and stream the movies and never worry about any of it? I didn't know it could be that easy. I didn't know that until just now. That sounds good to me.\n14164\n0\n14165\n0\n14166\nI'm just going to put out three or four releases a year and make it so that if you like the Desert Sessions, then you'll definitely like everything else.\n14167\n0\n14168\n0\n14169\n0\n14170\n0\n14171\n0\n14172\n0\n14173\n0\n14174\n0\n14175\nIt was important to buy into the fact that the nine hundred pages an end-reader never sees are just as valuable as the ones that are bound and placed on the shelf.\n14176\n0\n14177\n0\n14178\n0\n14179\n0\n14180\n0\n14181\n0\n14182\n0\n14183\n0\n14184\n0\n14185\n0\n14186\n0\n14187\n0\n14188\n0\n14189\n0\n14190\n0\n14191\nI feel like I'm a quick learner and I'm also very quick to forget. That's why I can't play an instrument because I can't bloody remember it.\n14192\nThere's a time and place for everything, and I believe it’s called 'fan fiction'.\n14193\n0\n14194\n0\n14195\n0\n14196\nI have a friend who actually told me that she'd rather be dead than be fat. This is a woman who, if I order a sandwich at lunch, she'll order a salad. If I order a salad, she'll order half a cantaloupe. If I order half a cantaloupe, she'll order a cup of coffee. This bizarre contest continues until she's down to sucking on a mint-flavored toothpick. At this rate, her preference for dying over being fat could be a reality sooner than she thinks.\n14197\nWhen I was younger, I was one of the few girls in the neighborhood who could break dance. That's kind of my local, ghetto-celebrity claim to fame.\n14198\n0\n14199\n0\n14200\n0\n14201\n0\n14202\n0\n14203\n0\n14204\nThe brain is a muscle of busy hills, the struggle of unthought things with things eternally thought.\n14205\n0\n14206\n0\n14207\n0\n14208\n0\n14209\n0\n14210\n0\n14211\nSpending time with God is the key to our strength and success in all areas of life. Be sure that you never try to work God into your schedule, but always work your schedule around Him.\n14212\n0\n14213\n0\n14214\n0\n14215\nYou can't be what you don't see. I didn't think about being a doctor. I didn't even think about being a clerk in a store, I'd never seen a black clerk in a clothing store.\n14216\n0\n14217\n0\n14218\n0\n14219\n0\n14220\n0\n14221\n0\n14222\n0\n14223\n0\n14224\n0\n14225\n0\n14226\n0\n14227\n0\n14228\n0\n14229\n0\n14230\n0\n14231\n0\n14232\n0\n14233\nEurope would be well advised to pay more attention to Latin America. The emerging economies are the engines of the global economy. Colombia has done too little to improve its reputation in Europe.\n14234\n0\n14235\n0\n14236\n0\n14237\n0\n14238\n0\n14239\n0\n14240\n0\n14241\n0\n14242\n0\n14243\n0\n14244\nVoting is a Constitutional right. Absent any evidence of fraud, all Americans have a protected right to vote, be they rich or poor, black, Hispanic or white, people who live in a big city or in remote rural areas.\n14245\n0\n14246\n0\n14247\n0\n14248\n0\n14249\n0\n14250\n0\n14251\nThere was definitely a period when I just felt out of sync with earth.\n14252\n0\n14253\n0\n14254\nI had to audition for Fandango. When I read the script, the role that was interesting - so everyone thought - was the role that Costner played. He was the cool guy. And I read the script, and my representation at the time said, \"That's the role you should read for.\" And I was like, \"Really? How about I read for this other role.\" And they went, \"Well, you're not going to get that role.\"\n14255\n0\n14256\n0\n14257\nI'm keen to do as little or as much reading and watching as the director may advise, and often off that you kind of stem into other things that you find of influence, perhaps the things that you're watching. It's a good excuse to get to know a new profession, or a new approach, or a new era. It's about authenticity. It's about having the confidence to really feel that you're saturated and know the world you're about to step into and understand the person you're about to be.\n14258\n0\n14259\nThe theater is the thing I love doing most.\n14260\n0\n14261\n0\n14262\n0\n14263\n0\n14264\nIn the first instance, performativity must be understood not as a singular or deliberate ‘act,’ but, rather, as the reiterative and citational practice by which discourse produces the effects that it names\n14265\n0\n14266\n0\n14267\n0\n14268\n0\n14269\n0\n14270\n0\n14271\n0\n14272\n0\n14273\nI think it's very important for me to work on myself while I'm working on a character, and also it's important how I'm giving to and educating an audience. So I tend to go with people who are complex and substantive.\n14274\n0\n14275\n0\n14276\n0\n14277\nAdopting the behaviors and habits of surrendered people helps us improve our relationships, feel love and gratitude, get healthier, give up destructive people and behavior patterns, and become more successful and influential in our lives and careers. And that's just the tip of the iceberg as far as benefits go.\n14278\n0\n14279\n0\n14280\n0\n14281\n0\n14282\n0\n14283\n0\n14284\n0\n14285\n0\n14286\n0\n14287\n0\n14288\n0\n14289\n0\n14290\n0\n14291\n0\n14292\nWith \"Margaret,\" I remember clearly it was, you know because I did remember it clearly. I was young. I was young in terms of experience and what did I know about and I had an incredible memory from my own childhood. And so it never occurred to me to write for any other age group. And I thought I'm going to write a book and I'm going to tell the truth.\n14293\n0\n14294\n0\n14295\n0\n14296\nI am just glad that I can take the music to the people who want to hear it. I love my audiences. I am deeply indebted to them for giving me the chance to sing my concerts, make records, and do what I love. Whatever people call it, it is great to have a voice!\n14297\n0\n14298\n0\n14299\n0\n14300\n0\n14301\n0\n14302\nMaybe when we were shooting in the school, I was feeling more like it. Every time I go back to a school for work, I always feel so huge. Everything seems so little. The lockers seem smaller than I remember and the length of the hallways seem shorter when you're a kid.\n14303\n0\n14304\n0\n14305\n0\n14306\n0\n14307\n0\n14308\n0\n14309\n0\n14310\n0\n14311\nPolitics is in my blood. I'd love to be involved in 2008, maybe even '06.\n14312\n0\n14313\n0\n14314\n0\n14315\n0\n14316\n0\n14317\n0\n14318\nI love performing, signing autographs, taking 'selfies' with the fans. This is just what I feel like I was born to do.\n14319\n0\n14320\n0\n14321\nWhen you do the kind of work I do, everything is challenging, but probably the most challenging thing is getting up in the morning and getting on with it because it's so easy to stay in bed and not get on with it.\n14322\n0\n14323\n0\n14324\n0\n14325\nIt's always gratifying to hear from a passionate reader, and as a longtime educator, I'm especially pleased and heartened when that reader is a young student who is inspired to write me and let me know that my book has helped him or her find her way.\n14326\n0\n14327\n0\n14328\n0\n14329\n0\n14330\n0\n14331\nThe death of Malcolm Fraser underwrites a great loss to Australia... I always thought Malcolm would be around a lot longer. I must say, I wished he had been.\n14332\n0\n14333\n0\n14334\n0\n14335\n0\n14336\n0\n14337\nI'm not the type to cut back on hot showers, but there's no harm in hot water when it's warmed by the sun.\n14338\n0\n14339\n0\n14340\n0\n14341\n0\n14342\nDon't forget I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.\n14343\n0\n14344\n0\n14345\n0\n14346\n0\n14347\nI think it's really special to be a part of something that people are still watching or thinking about or interested in, or remember fondly many years later. I don't think it's annoying at all.\n14348\n0\n14349\n0\n14350\nThere is unity in the oppression. There must be absolute unity and determination, in the response.\n14351\nReading is a majority skill but a minority art.\n14352\n0\n14353\n0\n14354\nI guess the best thing about marriage is the fact you've got the coolest partner you can imagine by your side for all the things you're going to face in your life. So far, Juliet's been there for me. She's been good for my voice, good for my everything.\n14355\nDonald Trump ought to realise that being a president is different to being a candidate and that there is a responsibility that comes with the office.\n14356\n0\n14357\n0\n14358\n0\n14359\n0\n14360\n0\n14361\nWar makes early risers of us all.\n14362\n0\n14363\n0\n14364\n0\n14365\n0\n14366\n0\n14367\n0\n14368\n0\n14369\n0\n14370\n0\n14371\n0\n14372\n0\n14373\nMy early paintings weren't that good - I was very influenced by Francis Bacon. But there was a kind of intensity there. And however influenced they may have been by other people, even my earliest paintings were recognisably my own.\n14374\n0\n14375\n0\n14376\n0\n14377\n0\n14378\nI want to paint. That is probably going to sound so pretentious coming from someone who's been a musician.\n14379\nI'm a woman, but I've been a sexist, too.\n14380\nI'm the kind of person who always has to be on time and I'm incredibly professional.\n14381\nI had a hard time with bullying. I ate lunch in the bathroom.\n14382\nIndeed, as soon as he took office, Senator Mitch McConnell announced that his top priority was to deny President [Barack] Obama a second term.\n14383\nIt's pretty boring, working by yourself. The scene happens in between the two of you, and then you don't know what it's going to be because it's a kind of combustion. So, you do take something from every actor you work with.\n14384\n0\n14385\n0\n14386\n0\n14387\nI would like to make one thing quite clear. ... I never explain anything.\n14388\n0\n14389\n0\n14390\n0\n14391\nWhen I first started I was always known as The Girl on the Sitcom with the Funny Voice.\n14392\n0\n14393\n0\n14394\n0\n14395\nI've had a little bad, bad media luck the new year. Well, apparently I'm dating Bill Clinton, which makes me nervous. I didn't know, though.\n14396\n0\n14397\n0\n14398\n0\n14399\n0\n14400\n0\n14401\n0\n14402\nThe people that are succeeding have often had a mentor of some kind. I think it makes a huge difference.\n14403\n0\n14404\n0\n14405\n0\n14406\n0\n14407\n0\n14408\n0\n14409\n0\n14410\n0\n14411\n0\n14412\n0\n14413\n0\n14414\n0\n14415\n0\n14416\n0\n14417\n0\n14418\n0\n14419\n0\n14420\n0\n14421\n0\n14422\n0\n14423\n0\n14424\n0\n14425\n0\n14426\n0\n14427\n0\n14428\nThe one thing we can't really train for is weightlessness, real weightlessness. It's a ton of fun. It's pure Newtonian physics. You push in one direction, you go in the opposite direction with an equal force.\n14429\n0\n14430\n0\n14431\n0\n14432\n0\n14433\n0\n14434\n0\n14435\nIn America, the word art has become like the word adultery. It's this big scarlet letter. When you say you're an artist, people are like, \"Ugh.\"\n14436\nJane Austen was an extraordinary woman; to actually be able to survive as a novelist in those days - unmarried - was just unheard of.\n14437\n0\n14438\n0\n14439\n0\n14440\n0\n14441\n0\n14442\n0\n14443\n0\n14444\n0\n14445\n0\n14446\nI never really worked in Hollywood. Some American producers came to Europe to shoot films with me, so it's a different situation... It was not my aim.\n14447\nIn acting, you have a writer, a director, a character - you're working through being another person - and the irony I always tell people is when I acted early on as a teenager, it actually kept me out of trouble.\n14448\n0\n14449\n0\n14450\n0\n14451\n0\n14452\n0\n14453\n0\n14454\n0\n14455\n0\n14456\n0\n14457\n0\n14458\n0\n14459\n0\n14460\nI remember watching 21 Jump Street and thinking I'm attracted to Johnny Depp - \"What are these feelings?\" I remember all of this, the first time you feel things. I mean, yes, boys in class, whatever, but to specifically go back to those experiences, it's kind of amazing.\n14461\n0\n14462\n0\n14463\n0\n14464\n0\n14465\n0\n14466\n0\n14467\n0\n14468\n0\n14469\n0\n14470\n0\n14471\n0\n14472\n0\n14473\n0\n14474\n0\n14475\nThere's such an array of brilliant roles for young women. You read all these amazing young women going through different stages in their life - different stages, different fascinations, different textualities, different friendships.\n14476\nThe anti-immigrant logic has basically saturated our world. I'm staying, and I'm fighting.\n14477\n0\n14478\n0\n14479\n0\n14480\n0\n14481\n0\n14482\n0\n14483\n0\n14484\n0\n14485\n0\n14486\n0\n14487\n0\n14488\n0\n14489\n0\n14490\n0\n14491\n0\n14492\n0\n14493\n0\n14494\n0\n14495\n0\n14496\n0\n14497\n0\n14498\nFriends are the best to turn to when you're having a rough day.\n14499\n0\n14500\n0\n14501\n0\n14502\n0\n14503\n0\n14504\n0\n14505\n0\n14506\n0\n14507\n0\n14508\n0\n14509\n0\n14510\n0\n14511\nI've certainly been to Hollywood parties, and I have friends that are ridiculous - wonderful people - but they're high rollers with tons of money.\n14512\n0\n14513\n0\n14514\n0\n14515\n0\n14516\n0\n14517\n0\n14518\n0\n14519\nWhen you hear a famous voice, sometimes that takes me out of the movie.\n14520\n0\n14521\n0\n14522\n0\n14523\n0\n14524\n0\n14525\n0\n14526\n0\n14527\n0\n14528\n0\n14529\n0\n14530\n0\n14531\n0\n14532\n0\n14533\nI've always been pretty happy with my style. I've been wearing tapered jeans since 1980 something.\n14534\nEvery time you do a project, you learn something new.\n14535\n0\n14536\nBusiness as usual doesn't work, that we're in a time where we have to rethink a lot of the basic ground rules and assumptions of our civilizations.\n14537\n0\n14538\n0\n14539\nIt makes sense that that's part of the story and everything, but that's part of any story of any record - where was it record and how long and what were the people doing. I think people want to know where these events are made. That's why I like the word \"record.\"\n14540\n0\n14541\n0\n14542\n0\n14543\n0\n14544\n0\n14545\n0\n14546\n0\n14547\nI've known white Australian girls from wealthy families who were sent to posh private schools, who knew all of that stuff, and I think would recognise much in Jefferson's book.

I've worked on my passions obsessively. How can I say what I want to say more precisely than the last time I said it? Success is such an elusive concept. When you work for it, I think you get it in a way you might regret it.\n14563\n0\n14564\nWhen you are a filmmaker, you need to be rooted, because committing yourself to producing or directing a film is a good three-year process.\n14565\nI know not every song has to be a powerful message.\n14566\n0\n14567\n0\n14568\n0\n14569\n0\n14570\n0\n14571\nMy goal is to be a contributor and to encourage others as they realize their dreams.\n14572\n0\n14573\n0\n14574\n0\n14575\n0\n14576\n0\n14577\n0\n14578\n0\n14579\nEvery parent craves for a child, and once their wishes come true, they feel that it's not possible for them to love anyone more that the first born.

We didn't have the food or luxuries we wanted. We didn't have a laundry service. So every night after the match, I soaped up my uniform in the shower. I learned to rely on outside things as little as possible, whether it was music or massage. I just got out of the habit of relying on outside things.\n14632\n0\n14633\nOne man cannot make a team.\n14634\n0\n14635\n0\n14636\n0\n14637\nWhen Gypsy was older, after she became Gypsy Rose Lee, I think she was both proud and slightly ashamed of her Seattle roots.

For some reason some of them are quite young, so they are quite frightened.\n14746\nThe transgender movement even divides itself up by gender, as many folks stick with their same trans-genders (female-to-male or male-to-female). Additionally, the movement gets strangely subdivided among, for example, male cross-dressers, sissy boys, butch women, femme dykes, drag kings, drag queens, transvestites, intersexed, transsexuals (post-op, pre-op, and non-op).\n14747\nI can't deal with someone flashy.

Which works in a lot of situations but in a lot of situations you look at it and you're like, \"Come on. Could you please get someone in there who actually has biceps and not just because they don't eat?\"\n14801\n0\n14802\n0\n14803\n0\n14804\nIt was never about sort of being famous.

But in some ways I think writers of fiction are the creatures most to be envied, because who else besides the spider is allowed to take that fragile thread and weave it into a pattern? What a gift of grace to be able to take the chaos from within and from it to create some semblance of order.\n14828\n0\n14829\n0\n14830\n0\n14831\n0\n14832\n0\n14833\n0\n14834\n0\n14835\n0\n14836\n0\n14837\nI like sitting in the dark and watching people far more talented than I'll ever be sing my songs and say my words.

I had 24 miles to go and you cannot run 24 miles and stay angry. That's the truth. When we go out and we're mad at our boss or mad at the world, when we run, we get it out of our system.\n14855\n0\n14856\nThere's room enough for everyone to thrive.\n14857\nThere are some days where, at the end of the day, you've done OK.

Well, there never was anything he could say, that's the funny thing. It was all the stupid, desperately optimistic, condescending things he didn't say that kept me alive; all the compassion and wamrth I felt from him that could not have been said; all the intelligence, competence, and time he put into it; and his granite belief that mine was a life worth living.\n14940\n0\n14941\n0\n14942\n0\n14943\n0\n14944\n0\n14945\n0\n14946\n0\n14947\n0\n14948\n0\n14949\n0\n14950\n0\n14951\nAs with a wound on one's own body, it is possible to develop an intimacy with the most disturbing of things\n14952\n0\n14953\n0\n14954\n0\n14955\n0\n14956\n0\n14957\n0\n14958\n0\n14959\nGrief changes shape, but it never ends.\n14960\n0\n14961\n0\n14962\n0\n14963\n0\n14964\n0\n14965\n0\n14966\nOne time I said to Jordan [Peele], in a text, \"I will pick you up at 2:30.

There's nothing I can do about that. I'm aware, probably much more aware than my harshest critic, of what my own problems are with my acting ability.

The truth is, there are concepts that are constantly being repeated in this world, since the beginning of time, but it doesn't seem like any of us have mastered them. So my advice is to keep going with the topic, which usually has to do with redemption, love, compassion, freedom, injustice, perversion, divinity, the diabolical... keep going with your thoughts, and your heart, and push them through to transformation.\n15055\n0\n15056\n0\n15057\n0\n15058\n0\n15059\nI didn't really feel any pressure when I've made records, I haven't as yet anyway. I feel when I'm making a record that I'm so excited about making new songs that when I'm doing demos of new songs, as soon as I make one that's really different I get really excited about the record, I don't care about the last record anymore.\n15060\n0\n15061\n0\n15062\n0\n15063\n0\n15064\n0\n15065\n0\n15066\n0\n15067\n0\n15068\n0\n15069\nI've completely changed the way I eat since doing 'Dancing With The Stars.\n15070\n0\n15071\n0\n15072\n0\n15073\n0\n15074\n0\n15075\nIf I'm exhausted and I just don't feel like it, then I don't do it. I am a human being, after all. But I also know I'm the kind of person who, if I take one day off, well, it's very easy for me to take the next day off and then quit exercising.\n15076\n0\n15077\nI typically like to train with the mentality of a high-performance athlete. I put in the work and do what it takes to be successful. A typical workout routine consists of sprint-based training combined with strength moves two days a week.

You know, this whole sisterhood, this whole let's go march for women's rights and, you know, just constantly talking about what women look like or what they wear, or making fun of their choices or presuming that they're not as powerful as the men around. This presumptive negativity about women in power I think is very unfortunate, because let's just try to access that and have a conversation about it, rather than a confrontation about it.\n15084\n0\n15085\n0\n15086\n0\n15087\n0\n15088\n0\n15089\n0\n15090\n0\n15091\n0\n15092\n0\n15093\n0\n15094\n0\n15095\n0\n15096\n0\n15097\n0\n15098\n0\n15099\n0\n15100\n0\n15101\n0\n15102\n0\n15103\nThe flame is not out, but it is flickering.\n15104\n0\n15105\n0\n15106\n0\n15107\n0\n15108\n0\n15109\n0\n15110\n0\n15111\n0\n15112\n0\n15113\n0\n15114\n0\n15115\n0\n15116\n0\n15117\n0\n15118\n0\n15119\n0\n15120\n0\n15121\n0\n15122\n0\n15123\n0\n15124\n0\n15125\n0\n15126\n0\n15127\n0\n15128\n0\n15129\n0\n15130\n0\n15131\n0\n15132\n0\n15133\n0\n15134\n0\n15135\n0\n15136\n0\n15137\n0\n15138\n0\n15139\n0\n15140\n0\n15141\n0\n15142\n0\n15143\n0\n15144\n0\n15145\n0\n15146\n0\n15147\n0\n15148\n0\n15149\n0\n15150\n0\n15151\n0\n15152\n0\n15153\n0\n15154\n0\n15155\n0\n15156\n0\n15157\n0\n15158\n0\n15159\n0\n15160\n0\n15161\nThe great and rare mystics of the past . . . were, in fact, ahead of their time, and are still ahead of ours.

I didn't have knowledge that becoming an artist was an option. I'm not from a wealthy family, and when you come from those circumstances, doing art isn't really an option.\n15271\nParents should not let kids listen to my music if it's offensive.

There are parts of me that are in every movie that I've done. That to me is what my job is.\n15375\n0\n15376\n0\n15377\nI have a pretty random life. I run a business and go all over the world doing things for that business, things that are fairly orthogonal. But my job is to run my company, not to be the best Instagrammer.

It didn't make everything all right. It didn't make ANYTHING all right. Only a smile. A tiny thing. A leaf in the woods, shaking in the wake of a startled bird's flight. But I'll take it. With open arms.

OK, I liked certain people, but the idea of mankind'-it really irritated me!\n15570\n0\n15571\n0\n15572\n0\n15573\n0\n15574\n0\n15575\n0\n15576\n0\n15577\nAt drama school, I was always playing the 11-year-old boys.\n15578\n0\n15579\n0\n15580\n0\n15581\n0\n15582\n0\n15583\n0\n15584\n0\n15585\n0\n15586\n0\n15587\n0\n15588\n0\n15589\n0\n15590\n0\n15591\n0\n15592\n0\n15593\n0\n15594\n0\n15595\n0\n15596\n0\n15597\n0\n15598\n0\n15599\n0\n15600\nBeing a leader, it's the art of trying to find the balance, the right times with each individual and what they need at that moment. It requires looking outward as opposed to looking inside.\n15601\n0\n15602\n0\n15603\nIf you are neutral in a situation where one side is patently being mistreated, the conclusion is that you're siding with this wrong.\n15604\n0\n15605\n0\n15606\n0\n15607\n0\n15608\n0\n15609\n0\n15610\n0\n15611\n0\n15612\nI never wanted anyone to know about me and Osama [Bin Laden]. I wanted that to be a secret that I carried to my grave, and since I wasn't the one who revealed it'it's definitely something that I wish was in the closet. It's destroyed my career.\n15613\n0\n15614\n0\n15615\n0\n15616\n0\n15617\n0\n15618\n0\n15619\n0\n15620\nAs I get older, I 've shied away from a lot of convention.

The first time I ever said a curse word was with my sister Kim.\n15626\n0\n15627\n0\n15628\n0\n15629\nI am a huge sports fan.\n15630\n0\n15631\n0\n15632\nMy refrigerator is powerful.

High school is a pit of despair. It's a swirling tornado of insecurities and there's really nothing good about it.\n15651\n0\n15652\n0\n15653\n0\n15654\nIt was only when I moved to New York that I realized tall is good.\n15655\n0\n15656\n0\n15657\nAt first the kid kicking the back of my airplane seat was enraging. Then I imagined it was a broken massage chair and I kinda liked it.\n15658\nI think romance is anything honest. As long as it's honest, it's so disarming.\n15659\n0\n15660\nI wish I had less fear about creating my own parts.\n15661\n0\n15662\n0\n15663\n0\n15664\n0\n15665\n0\n15666\n0\n15667\n0\n15668\nEvery mile marker can be met with some measure of trepidation, in a race or in life. Am I on target? Do I have what it takes to finish strong? Am I taking care to stay nourished so I can endure? Is my training proving to be sufficient? Am I prepared for the hills? It is impossible to fathom the full distance, so we make our way to the next mile marker, and the next, checking in with ourselves as we go.\n15669\nThe one thing I've come to figure out is this equation where the more uncomfortable I am, the better I'm going to look. I'm like, \"This one really hurts. I must look awesome!\" The corsets are uncomfortable, but they are so flattering. No, my waist will never be that small.\n15670\nI would love to have my own shoe line. That I would absolutely love.\n15671\nI love eating at Sonic with my family in Oklahoma. And no, I'm not kidding.\n15672\nDogs are very, very pleasant with people that they're connected to.\n15673\nI might screw up, I might embarrass you, I might yell at you, but I will never, ever stop loving you. You're my first born. The first time I held you... I fell in love so hard it cracked my bones.\n15674\n0\n15675\n0\n15676\nI took piano for many years. I kicked and screamed through all of my lessons, but my mom really insisted.\n15677\n0\n15678\n0\n15679\n0\n15680\n0\n15681\n0\n15682\n0\n15683\n0\n15684\n0\n15685\n0\n15686\n0\n15687\n0\n15688\n0\n15689\n0\n15690\n0\n15691\n0\n15692\nHip is the knowledge and Hop is the movement.\n15693\n0\n15694\nFrom the time I got the first couple of scripts [of Jessica Jones], I always felt that this was groundbreaking material and a groundbreaking character.\n15695\n0\n15696\n0\n15697\n0\n15698\n0\n15699\n0\n15700\n0\n15701\n0\n15702\n0\n15703\n0\n15704\n0\n15705\n0\n15706\n0\n15707\n0\n15708\n0\n15709\n0\n15710\n0\n15711\nThe metaphors exist for the stories.\n15712\n0\n15713\nI just don't feel like - I've never felt like - part of the entertainment industry. I still just feel like I'm trying to work my way in. And that's weird.\n15714\n0\n15715\n0\n15716\n0\n15717\nI do get cynical, but what can you do?

I don't mind at all that it sounds like LA, because LA was integral to me feeling better. Seeing the sunshine and all that other sorts of stuff was definitely a huge part in why the album sounds like it sounds.\n15804\n0\n15805\n0\n15806\n0\n15807\n0\n15808\n0\n15809\nThe amount of things you can do with a kettlebell is unsurpassed by any other training equipment - dumbbells, resistance machines, free weights.\n15810\n0\n15811\n0\n15812\n0\n15813\n0\n15814\nI'm in full transparency here of \"Yeah, I'm trying to find my financing.\"\n15815\n0\n15816\n0\n15817\n0\n15818\n0\n15819\n0\n15820\n0\n15821\n0\n15822\n0\n15823\n0\n15824\n0\n15825\n0\n15826\n0\n15827\n0\n15828\n0\n15829\n0\n15830\n0\n15831\n0\n15832\n0\n15833\nSometimes I wish I was a beautiful machine so I could resist your kiss and not cry when you're mean.\n15834\n0\n15835\n0\n15836\nMy advice to you is never stop believing.\n15837\nSame-gender attraction did not exist in the pre-earth life and neither will it exist in the next life. It is a circumstance that for whatever reason or reasons seems to apply right now in mortality, in this nano-second of our eternal existence.\n15838\n0\n15839\nI want to play every game of my career in an Astros uniform.\n15840\n0\n15841\nThere's a potter that lived back in the 1800s, in Biloxi, Mississippi, and his name was George Ohr. He was of Russian descent, but they called him the \"Mad Potter of Biloxi.\" I'd love to do a great character study and comedy about that guy's life. That would be my dream role. I know it's an oddball thing, but it's true. He lived at the turn of the century, in the 1800s.\n15842\n0\n15843\n0\n15844\n0\n15845\n0\n15846\nYou don't see a lot of black rock stars. The music industry tends to be segregated stylistically. It's hard for a black artist to cross over to rock music.\n15847\n0\n15848\n0\n15849\n0\n15850\n0\n15851\nNew England has two factors to get them ready to play. They've consistently been, if not the best, the second best team all year and they're playing confidently. And a lot of those guys were on field when they lost to LA. They'll take motivation in that.\n15852\n0\n15853\n0\n15854\n0\n15855\n0\n15856\n0\n15857\n0\n15858\n0\n15859\n0\n15860\n0\n15861\n0\n15862\n0\n15863\n0\n15864\n0\n15865\n0\n15866\n0\n15867\n0\n15868\n0\n15869\n0\n15870\n0\n15871\n0\n15872\n0\n15873\nIf I had to model clothes in a time period other than the 21st century, I think I'd like to model way back when they just wore skin loincloths. That would be best suited for me - better than corsets.

Their consumption is basically just a keeping up with the Joneses or let's buy the markers of success because this is what I'm supposed to have and this is what I'm supposed to do. And they are working so hard that they don't even have the time to think about what they might actually desire.\n15883\n0\n15884\nAs far as playing, I didn't care who guarded me - red, yellow, black. I just didn't want a white guy guarding me, because it's disrespect to my game.\n15885\n0\n15886\n0\n15887\n0\n15888\n0\n15889\n0\n15890\n0\n15891\n0\n15892\n0\n15893\n0\n15894\n0\n15895\n0\n15896\n0\n15897\n0\n15898\n0\n15899\n0\n15900\nOnce I know people know who I am, it gives me a lot of licence and freedom to behave in ways I wouldn't normally.\n15901\n0\n15902\n0\n15903\n0\n15904\nBill Gates wants people to think he's Edison, when he's really Rockefeller.

I don't know if I'll be associated with Don but I won't be a slave or puppet for him.\n15913\n0\n15914\n0\n15915\nNobody beats a bunch of journalists for inflating their rather mundane straightforward chores with a lot more melodrama and self-importance than the job should be asked to contain.\n15916\n0\n15917\n0\n15918\n0\n15919\n0\n15920\n0\n15921\nNo illusion is more crucial than the illusion that great success and huge money buy you immunity from the common ills of mankind, such as cars that won't start.\n15922\n0\n15923\n0\n15924\n0\n15925\n0\n15926\n0\n15927\n0\n15928\n0\n15929\n0\n15930\n0\n15931\n0\n15932\n0\n15933\n0\n15934\n0\n15935\n0\n15936\n0\n15937\n0\n15938\n0\n15939\n0\n15940\n0\n15941\n0\n15942\n0\n15943\nWe try to make the name longer and longer every year. First, it was 'Larry the Cable Guy's Christmas Spectacular.' Then it was 'It's a Very Larry Christmas.' Now it's 'Larry the Cable Guy's Hula-palooza Christmas Luau.' I'll tell you what it is: It's funny. That's what it is. Who cares what the name of it is? It is a funny special.\n15944\nNot that I have anything much against redundancy. But I said that already.\n15945\n0\n15946\n0\n15947\n0\n15948\nWhen I was a kid, there was kind of a given that there were some really bad, racist police out there. That's just what America was like when I was a kid.\n15949\nThere are four basic emotions - mad, sad, glad and scared. And if you touch those emotions then you can grab your audience, your reader.\n15950\n0\n15951\n0\n15952\n0\n15953\n0\n15954\n0\n15955\n0\n15956\n0\n15957\n0\n15958\nI guess that seeing yourself on a screen is something that you get used to. Let's face it, these days, there's really nothing that you do that doesn't get filmed.\n15959\nI like gardening. I'm really a nature man. I spend as much time as I can in nature. I feel really safe there.\n15960\n0\n15961\nABBA: The Movie; I got a lot of grief for working on that.\n15962\n0\n15963\n0\n15964\n0\n15965\n0\n15966\nI am pleased to tell you that he is finally getting some rest and is regaining his appetite as well.\n15967\n0\n15968\n0\n15969\n0\n15970\n0\n15971\n0\n15972\nThis way, if I did the album myself, and I produced it myself with my own label, it was going to be done the way I wanted to do it. If people like it or don't like it, it doesn't matter; I got something that means something to me.\n15973\nI was always a little adult. Even as a little kid, I just couldn't understand why I was surrounded by all these kids. I took things very seriously.\n15974\n0\n15975\n0\n15976\n0\n15977\nResearch shows us that children who are read to from a very early age are more likely to begin reading themselves at an early age. They're more likely to excell in school. They're more likely to graduate secondary school and go to college.\n15978\n0\n15979\n0\n15980\n0\n15981\n0\n15982\n0\n15983\n0\n15984\nWhat about good small roles for women?

And it's such a shallow way to exist as far as our evolution is concerned, and our culture is concerned. It's fun to watch women fight, in a storytelling way, but in the world, women shouldn't be seen as a threat to other women.\n16004\nIt's very different to have this kid that I'm truly responsible for.\n16005\n0\n16006\nI feel sometimes that I'm in a constant state of being lost in translation, and I guess that why I write songs.\n16007\n0\n16008\n0\n16009\nFor while agents and editors often misunderstand their market and sometimes reject good or even great works, they do prevent a vast quantity of truly execrable writing from being published.\n16010\n0\n16011\n0\n16012\n0\n16013\n0\n16014\n0\n16015\n0\n16016\nI'm the type of person that will do triple sessions in one day.

Of course, the video becomes more than that. It goes deeper than that. But it's not a lie.

I'm not sure what it was about to be honest, I think it was probably just something along the lines of teen angst.\n16066\n0\n16067\nAnd you're figuring out who you are, and you haven't yet become stagnant in your thinking. You haven't solidified.

But for me living a lie was much worse. I need to be in my truth.

The single unifying force should be that we govern ourselves.\n16143\n0\n16144\nWe now know that we are more insignificant than we ever imagined.

There was no CG involved, it was just painfully taking Collin [Farrell] and Jessica Biel and putting them upside-down, we built the set upside-down and just try to twist perspective to make it all seem like zero gravity. And it was one of the most difficult things I've ever shot.\n16306\nI sort of tend to equate tattoos with prisoners, punks or people with a high level of self-confidence.

Then we have the Darwinian myths that life is a struggle to survive. However all life is not about competition but about striving for wholeness. When we compete we are weak, and when we work together we are strong. My hope is that this will become common knowledge someday because this will transcend religion as we know it. We just need to start focusing on the commonalities of religion.\n17123\nI do love that discovery of when you're trying to figure out how to make something work, and it happens in a way that you didn't predict.\n17124\n0\n17125\n0\n17126\n0\n17127\n0\n17128\n0\n17129\n0\n17130\n0\n17131\nGod is mighty.

I don't ever want to see that look in your eyes again.\n17145\n0\n17146\n0\n17147\nI love the sound of Elmore James, the sound early guitarists like him got just by using minimal means.\n17148\nI hate the idea of street art. With music, I just needed my brain and my voice, which didn't cost anything.\n17149\n0\n17150\n0\n17151\n0\n17152\n0\n17153\n0\n17154\n0\n17155\n0\n17156\n0\n17157\nI like guitar. It just turned out that it's the instrument I learned to play. I have a lot of respect for it and I'm learning more and more everyday.\n17158\n0\n17159\n0\n17160\n0\n17161\nThey told me never fall in love, It never works out in your favor. You way too young and right now that's just human nature.\n17162\n0\n17163\n0\n17164\n0\n17165\n0\n17166\n0\n17167\n0\n17168\n0\n17169\n0\n17170\n0\n17171\nI wanted to be Beetlejuice. I watched nonstop 'Beetlejuice' and 'The Princess Bride' growing up.\n17172\n0\n17173\n0\n17174\nWhatever God you believe in, we come from the same one\n17175\n0\n17176\n0\n17177\n0\n17178\n0\n17179\n0\n17180\nWe must be authors of the history of our age.\n17181\n0\n17182\n0\n17183\n0\n17184\n0\n17185\nWhat's amazing to me is how many of the issues facing women in the ancient world still linger today. Take Odysseus' wife, Penelope, a brilliant, resourceful woman who ends up in a terrible situation: in her husband's absence, she is being held hostage in her own home by men who claim to be courting her. She tries to make them leave, but because she's a woman they refuse, blaming their bad behavior on her desirability.\n17186\n0\n17187\n0\n17188\n0\n17189\n0\n17190\n0\n17191\n0\n17192\n0\n17193\n0\n17194\nFame is a by-product. It's not a goal. What matters is loving your work and loving what you do\n17195\nYeah, I do all the stuff I can. Let’s be frank, if you are in an action film, you are not in it for the characters, you are in it for the action – the stunts. If they take that away from you, it’s a sad story. Ha ha! I have damaged everything: knees, elbows, ribs. But I’m an old gymnast. I know how to survive.\n17196\n0\n17197\n0\n17198\n0\n17199\nI love to watch 'Chopped,' 'Jeopardy,' and 'Breaking Bad.' You can't pass up that one. Oh! One other show I love to watch is 'Suburgatory.'\n17200\n0\n17201\n0\n17202\n0\n17203\n0\n17204\n0\n17205\n0\n17206\n0\n17207\n0\n17208\n0\n17209\n0\n17210\nI'm still trying to figure out what the right line is between myself and the people I play. Sometimes I go too far one way or too far the other.\n17211\n0\n17212\n0\n17213\n0\n17214\nI went back to China and did a movie in Mandarin, and I don't speak Mandarin, so I learned it phonetically. Now, when I'm on set and somebody gives me English lines, I'm like, \"Are you kidding? What's happening? This is amazing!\"\n17215\n0\n17216\nI think he [Leonardo DiCaprio] is a terrific actor. And I've - I've been rooting and voting for him since \"Gilbert Grape.\" I thought he was so amazing in that one. He was a young man, really very young boy.\n17217\nI had so much free time that free time was meaningless.\n17218\n0\n17219\n0\n17220\n0\n17221\n0\n17222\n0\n17223\n0\n17224\nMaybe if I didn't have the talent in chess I'd find the talent in something else. The only thing I know is that I have talent in chess, and I'm satisfied with that.\n17225\n0\n17226\nEven in South Africa, the Commonwealth were not doing anything, and their attitude was to tolerate apartheid in South Africa. There was a lot of lip service being paid to the need to stop this practice, but nothing was done.\n17227\n0\n17228\n0\n17229\n0\n17230\n0\n17231\nI remember after 9/11, I started - I was working quite a bit in Vancouver. And then I realized I would go to catch my flight, and it would take me like 20 minutes to get cleared to fly, like, every time. I'm like, what is going on?\n17232\n0\n17233\n0\n17234\n0\n17235\n0\n17236\n0\n17237\n0\n17238\nThe world powers established this filthy bacteria, the Zionist regime, which is lashing out at the nations in the region like a wild beast.\n17239\n0\n17240\n0\n17241\n0\n17242\nA lot of the stuff that we say about drugs is just wrong.\n17243\n0\n17244\n0\n17245\n0\n17246\nI support this proposal and agree with this great and important initiative to abolish militarism and war.  I will continue to speak out for an end to the institution of militarism and war and for institutions built on international law and human rights and nonviolent conflict resolution.\n17247\n0\n17248\nIt's huge in the U.K., if someone's doing well, to put them down. That's what we do all the time. It's kind of like a cultural thing.\n17249\n0\n17250\n0\n17251\n0\n17252\n0\n17253\n0\n17254\n0\n17255\n0\n17256\nI kind of miss the old sleazy Times Square, in a way. And yet I don't mind not being accosted by all sorts of strange people.\n17257\n0\n17258\n0\n17259\nThey thought that the bullets would silence us, but they failed.\n17260\n0\n17261\n0\n17262\n0\n17263\n0\n17264\nIncompetence annoys me. Overconfidence terrifies me.\n17265\n0\n17266\n0\n17267\n0\n17268\n0\n17269\n0\n17270\n0\n17271\nMy commitment to the Republican movement was pure and simply patriotism, a love of Australia... a desire or passion that all of our national symbols should be unequivocally and unambiguously Australian.\n17272\n0\n17273\n0\n17274\n0\n17275\n0\n17276\n0\n17277\n0\n17278\n0\n17279\n0\n17280\n0\n17281\nI don't think many people were, but I love the black, the tassels and the leather, obviously. I'm still wearing that. I haven't let go of that. I love all things leather, and so I love that from her outfits as well. But I don't know if I would necessarily do the Mozart top, the button down, the 'Hot For Teacher' kind of look. That's not really my thing. I would let that one go.\n17282\n0\n17283\n0\n17284\n0\n17285\n0\n17286\nIt's OK to tell your partner to objectify you. That's part of the fun of having a partner.\n17287\n0\n17288\n0\n17289\n0\n17290\n0\n17291\n0\n17292\n0\n17293\n0\n17294\n0\n17295\n0\n17296\n0\n17297\n0\n17298\n0\n17299\n0\n17300\nMy mom has always been my support system. She taught me to never give up and to keep pursuing my passions no matter what.\n17301\nThe great love of my life is music.\n17302\n0\n17303\n0\n17304\n0\n17305\n0\n17306\n0\n17307\n0\n17308\n0\n17309\n0\n17310\n0\n17311\n0\n17312\n0\n17313\nWhat India needs most is a unified food law.\n17314\n0\n17315\n0\n17316\n0\n17317\n0\n17318\nWell you know it's dangerous in politics, because especially in the Philippines there's a lot of killing in politics.\n17319\n0\n17320\n0\n17321\n0\n17322\n0\n17323\nI'm a doodler. It was my first job as a boy, and I still do it. At night I keep a block of paper and a pencil with a huge piece of string next to me. When I have an idea, I grab the string and just doodle.\n17324\n0\n17325\n0\n17326\n0\n17327\n0\n17328\n0\n17329\n0\n17330\n0\n17331\n0\n17332\n0\n17333\n0\n17334\n0\n17335\n0\n17336\n0\n17337\nDoes Donald Trump accept the results and concede graciously, pursue legal action, or tell his followers to take to the streets?\n17338\nIf I ever have children of my own, they will read Matilda. They will watch the movie. And you can bet they will see Matilda: The Musical.\n17339\n0\n17340\n0\n17341\n0\n17342\nIt's a shame in a way that people come and go with one album.\n17343\n0\n17344\n0\n17345\n0\n17346\n0\n17347\n0\n17348\nDon't forget to do something for other people.\n17349\n0\n17350\n0\n17351\n0\n17352\n0\n17353\n0\n17354\n0\n17355\n0\n17356\n0\n17357\n0\n17358\n0\n17359\n0\n17360\n0\n17361\n0\n17362\n0\n17363\n0\n17364\n0\n17365\n0\n17366\n0\n17367\nI still appreciate individuality. Style is much more interesting than fashion, really.\n17368\n0\n17369\n0\n17370\n0\n17371\n0\n17372\n0\n17373\nWhat comics sacrifice and what lives they live - I know that most of their lives, their adult lives, they're sitting around or walking around with notebooks, writing things down. Usually they're fairly sensitive. Usually they're very bright. And that makes them poets.\n17374\n0\n17375\n0\n17376\n0\n17377\n0\n17378\n0\n17379\nI made some salt and pepper shakers a while back and waited three years for them to come.\n17380\n0\n17381\n0\n17382\n0\n17383\n0\n17384\n0\n17385\n0\n17386\n0\n17387\n0\n17388\n0\n17389\n0\n17390\n0\n17391\nI think that the dramas that you find in TV are actually a lot more interesting, typically, than what you find in cinema.\n17392\n0\n17393\n0\n17394\n0\n17395\n0\n17396\n0\n17397\n0\n17398\n0\n17399\n0\n17400\n0\n17401\n0\n17402\n0\n17403\n0\n17404\n0\n17405\n0\n17406\n0\n17407\n0\n17408\n0\n17409\n0\n17410\n0\n17411\n0\n17412\n0\n17413\n0\n17414\n0\n17415\n0\n17416\n0\n17417\n0\n17418\n0\n17419\n0\n17420\n0\n17421\n0\n17422\nWe're in a world that is run by accountants and I think that it's sad in many ways.\n17423\n0\n17424\n0\n17425\nLet me just say the rules are what they are in the Republican Party. You have to have X-number of delegates in order to be the nominee. And if you don't have those number of delegates, then there's a process in place.Here is what would be a calamity, for Donald Trump to become our nominee.\n17426\n0\n17427\n0\n17428\n0\n17429\n0\n17430\n0\n17431\nYour strongest life is built through a continuous practice of designing moment by moment.\n17432\n0\n17433\n0\n17434\n0\n17435\n0\n17436\n0\n17437\n0\n17438\n0\n17439\n0\n17440\n0\n17441\n0\n17442\n0\n17443\n0\n17444\n0\n17445\n0\n17446\n0\n17447\n0\n17448\n0\n17449\nThanksgiving is one of my favorite American traditions. I quickly picked it up when I moved to the U.S. from Sweden.\n17450\n0\n17451\n0\n17452\n0\n17453\n0\n17454\n0\n17455\n0\n17456\n0\n17457\n0\n17458\n0\n17459\n0\n17460\n0\n17461\nTouch comes before sight, before speech. It is the first language and the last, and it always tells the truth.\n17462\n0\n17463\n0\n17464\n0\n17465\nHomophobia is a tough one. In some places it's actually very OK to be homophobic. Comedy clubs in general are very unsafe spaces for LGBT, for women, for Asian people. So my goal in comedy has sort of been to make this a safe space for people who were like me.\n17466\n0\n17467\n0\n17468\nAnd there isn't any way that one can get rid of the guilt of having a nice body by saying that one can serve society with it, because that would end up with oneself as what? There simply doesn't seem to be any moral place for flesh.\n17469\n0\n17470\n0\n17471\n0\n17472\n0\n17473\n0\n17474\n0\n17475\n0\n17476\n0\n17477\n0\n17478\n0\n17479\n0\n17480\n0\n17481\n0\n17482\n0\n17483\n0\n17484\n0\n17485\n0\n17486\n0\n17487\n0\n17488\n0\n17489\n0\n17490\n0\n17491\n0\n17492\n0\n17493\nIf you want to be listened to, you should put in time listening.\n17494\n0\n17495\n0\n17496\n0\n17497\n0\n17498\n0\n17499\n0\n17500\n0\n17501\n0\n17502\nI'm a very good screamer, that's for sure.\n17503\n0\n17504\nI don't want my Patronus to be a monkey! Even though that's totally what it is.\n17505\n0\n17506\nI represent all people who are citizens of the Danish nation.\n17507\n0\n17508\n0\n17509\n0\n17510\nI get sort of short with people and start grumbling and clearing my throat - in honor of my father - when I'm impatient. It's very charming.\n17511\nI'm not expecting a big sell-off but I do think that if we don't have a move toward economic growth and policies that will promote economic growth and get us out of this 2 percent world - we really need to see 4 percent, 5 percent - to see jobs created, and if we don't see that longer-term, yeah the market will sell-off...[but] I do think things are getting better. It's just been very slow.\n17512\nI was always anti-marriage. I didn't understand monogamy. I couldn't figure out how that could last. And then I met Bryn and I started to understand the beauty of constancy and history and change and going on the roller coaster with someone - of having a partner in life.\n17513\n0\n17514\n0\n17515\n0\n17516\n0\n17517\n0\n17518\n0\n17519\n0\n17520\n0\n17521\n0\n17522\n0\n17523\n0\n17524\n0\n17525\n0\n17526\n0\n17527\n0\n17528\n0\n17529\n0\n17530\n0\n17531\n0\n17532\n0\n17533\n0\n17534\n0\n17535\nOne of the main reasons I don't like leaving the house is because I might find myself face to face with a Canadian.\n17536\nMy main goal is to stay healthy because when you're injured you realise how lucky you are to have your health.\n17537\nInvesting in women, helping women to achieve their dreams, sending young girls to college. Trying to train young girls to be leaders. Sponsoring the Minerva Awards. All of these programs didn't exist before that help women day in and day out.\n17538\n0\n17539\n0\n17540\n0\n17541\nWe're all a little wacko sometimes, and if we think we're not, maybe we are more than we know.\n17542\n0\n17543\n0\n17544\n0\n17545\n0\n17546\n0\n17547\nIf we don't stand up for children, then we don't stand for much.\n17548\n0\n17549\nIf we look at the complexity of the challenges facing western societies today, we see that the problems are not really about outsiders, but have their roots much closer to home.\n17550\n0\n17551\n0\n17552\n0\n17553\nPenitentiary songs have been a love of mine for years. They are so wonderful.\n17554\n0\n17555\n0\n17556\n0\n17557\n0\n17558\n0\n17559\nWith every thought we think, we either summon or block a miracle. It is not our circumstances, then, but rather our thoughts about our circumstances, that determine our power to transform them.\n17560\n0\n17561\nI know what kind of pitcher Whitey was, and I know what kind of person Whitey is. It makes me feel proud to be a Yankee. We're keeping this in the family.\n17562\n0\n17563\n0\n17564\n0\n17565\n0\n17566\nWhen women live rich, in every sense of the word - financially, emotionally, physically, and spiritually - everyone wins: you win, your family wins, your community wins, and the world wins.\n17567\n0\n17568\n0\n17569\n0\n17570\n0\n17571\n0\n17572\n0\n17573\nYou can turn just about any simple act into a practice of mindfulness, and it will nurture and nourish you; it will start your day off in a positive way.\n17574\n0\n17575\n0\n17576\n0\n17577\n0\n17578\n0\n17579\n0\n17580\n0\n17581\n0\n17582\n0\n17583\n0\n17584\n0\n17585\n0\n17586\n0\n17587\n0\n17588\n0\n17589\n0\n17590\n0\n17591\n0\n17592\n0\n17593\nWhat nearly everybody in my life had misunderstood about Satanism was that it is not about ritual sacrifices, digging up graves and worshipping the devil. The devil doesn't exist. Satanism is about worshipping yourself, because you are responsible for your own good and evil.\n17594\n0\n17595\n0\n17596\n0\n17597\n0\n17598\n0\n17599\n0\n17600\n0\n17601\n0\n17602\n0\n17603\n0\n17604\nMemory is the sense of loss, and loss pulls us after it.\n17605\n0\n17606\nHappiness comes from the full understanding of your own being.\n17607\nI think each human being wants to make their mark on the world in whatever way they can, and maybe everyone has a slight egomaniac inside of them.\n17608\n0\n17609\nA society that doesn't know any longer how to observe every death with proper rituals, that does not know that death is not the end, but only part of the journey, has lost its way, has had the very heart of its humanity torn out.\n17610\nGlobalization has become an ideology with no constraints. And now, nations are forcing themselves back into the debate. Nations with borders we control, with people that we listen to, with real economies, not Wall Street economies, but rather factories and farmers. And this goes against this unregulated globalization, wild, savage globalization.\n17611\nI've lived this lifestyle as an artist and sometimes we get caught up in the fun, women and partying. But when you really sit back and think about it, it's not what fulfills you deep down inside and there's much more to experience in life than just that.\n17612\nI don't have many superstitions, just dumb things I don't talk about. I will not sign an autograph with a green pen.\n17613\n0\n17614\nShop often, shop hard, and spend for the best stuff available - logic dictates that you can make delicious food only with delicious ingredients.\n17615\n0\n17616\n0\n17617\nUnder theocracies and other authoritarian regimes, the rulers are the moral authorities. Under genuine democracy some basic values are entrenched in the legal system, which is expected to be under democratic vigilance, and others are left to the person or the group, which ideally debate moral problems in a rational, free and cooperative manner.\n17618\n0\n17619\n0\n17620\n0\n17621\n0\n17622\n0\n17623\n0\n17624\n0\n17625\n0\n17626\n0\n17627\n0\n17628\n0\n17629\n0\n17630\n0\n17631\nIn Los Angeles, individuality is very big, because people live in secluded bubbles. People don't walk around.

When the subject of alchemy started creeping into my stories, an astute mentor observed that the bits about alchemy might fit better in another time frame.

Like faxes, computer modems and other modern gadgets that have clogged out lives with phony urgency, cell phones represent the 20th Century's escalation of imaginary need. We didn't need cell phones until we had them.

So people learned to listen to us slowly over time. And, frankly, we learned how to listen to ourselves.

If you look through the Bible, there's a whole host of people who faced up to the glory of God and found themselves facedown in worship. So the album weaves through a theme of reverence, wonder, and mystery in worship, things I feel we really need to grasp more of in our worship expressions.

All the adults I've talked to remember fondly being afraid when they were kids. That's part of the reason they remember it and love it.

It's not really fair.\n18293\n0\n18294\nIn modern American politics, being the right kind of ignorant and entertainingly crazy is like having a big right hand in boxing; you've always got a puncher's chance.\n18295\n0\n18296\n0\n18297\n0\n18298\n0\n18299\n0\n18300\n0\n18301\n0\n18302\n0\n18303\n0\n18304\nI think all poetry is accessible in a certain sense if you spend enough time with it.\n18305\n0\n18306\n0\n18307\n0\n18308\n0\n18309\n0\n18310\n0\n18311\n0\n18312\n0\n18313\nThe first thing Jesus tells the church of Ephesus that He loves about them is they have sound doctrine.\n18314\n0\n18315\n0\n18316\n0\n18317\n0\n18318\n0\n18319\n0\n18320\n0\n18321\n0\n18322\n0\n18323\n0\n18324\n0\n18325\n0\n18326\n0\n18327\n0\n18328\n0\n18329\n0\n18330\nI'm beyond proud and happy - I never imagined I would have one fan, and there seems to be a few. I just couldn't be happier that people seem to like what I'm doing and seem to respond to it. If they weren't there, I don't know what I'd be doing right now.\n18331\n0\n18332\nI suppose I view my behavior in such a unique way. I frame it as an artist and maybe kind of make excuses for it.

I actually do prefer making films and television, but it was a learning experience for me, because I got into television at 5 and film at 11, and theater was something I completely bypassed.\n18346\nBeing an actor, when you sign onto a project - whether it's good, bad, or indifferent - you kind of fall in love with it. You fall in love with the experience, you fall in love with the memories.\n18347\n0\n18348\n0\n18349\nThere's two sorts of fear: one you embrace and one you should listen to and turn the other way.\n18350\n0\n18351\nThink of Frank Capra and Preston Sturges.

May my people understand the resemblance soon so that I can return to them. What we have in common are the words at our backs. The idioms for revenge are 'report a crime' and 'report to five families.' The reporting is the vengeance-not the beheading, not the gutting, but the words.\n18477\nThis nation has always struggled with how it was going to deal with poor people and people of color.

Why not? Farts are a repressed minority. The mouth gets to say all kinds of things, but the other place is supposed to keep quiet. But maybe our lower colons have something interesting to say. Maybe we should listen to them. Farts are human, more human than a lot of people I know.

It's a way to inform people of what's going on in their world. And when you make it about ratings and make it about ad dollars, there's no incentive to inform people.

A woman's second priority is the household. She wants to buy utensils, build a stronger roof, or find a bed for herself and her family. A man has an entirely different set of priorities. When a destitute father earns extra income, he focuses more attention on himself. Thus money entering a household through a woman brings more benefits to the family as a whole.\n19722\n0\n19723\n0\n19724\n0\n19725\n0\n19726\n0\n19727\n0\n19728\n0\n19729\n0\n19730\n0\n19731\n0\n19732\n0\n19733\n0\n19734\n0\n19735\n0\n19736\n0\n19737\n0\n19738\n0\n19739\n0\n19740\n0\n19741\n0\n19742\n0\n19743\n0\n19744\n0\n19745\n0\n19746\n0\n19747\n0\n19748\n0\n19749\n0\n19750\n0\n19751\n0\n19752\n0\n19753\n0\n19754\n0\n19755\n0\n19756\n0\n19757\n0\n19758\n0\n19759\n0\n19760\n0\n19761\n0\n19762\n0\n19763\n0\n19764\n0\n19765\n0\n19766\n0\n19767\n0\n19768\n0\n19769\n0\n19770\nGod's plan is not to abandon this world, the world which he said was \"very good.\" Rather, he intends to remake it.

Art should always be an exchange.\n20159\n0\n20160\n0\n20161\n0\n20162\n0\n20163\n0\n20164\n0\n20165\nSuperior writers, videographers and other content makers want to work with their own kind and for their own kind.\n20166\n0\n20167\n0\n20168\n0\n20169\n0\n20170\n0\n20171\n0\n20172\n0\n20173\nMy scripts are always heavily noted. If I can take a director to one side and say, \"Do you mind if we try this?,\" a few days before, that's usually a better way of doing it then on the day.\n20174\n0\n20175\n0\n20176\n0\n20177\n0\n20178\n0\n20179\n0\n20180\n0\n20181\n0\n20182\n0\n20183\n0\n20184\nAs a songwriter, the minute you start having sex, you can totally see the difference in the writing. You become an adult - that's kind of the whole backbone of it, really, your identity as a person and what sex means to you.\n20185\nThere's one theory that the funnier a comic is in his act, the more mind-numbingly boring he'll be when he's not holding a microphone.\n20186\n0\n20187\n0\n20188\n0\n20189\n0\n20190\nI'm very fussy about how my records sound, but I'm very aware that because of the way they sound, I will never be a big-selling, mainstream artist because the public has gotten conditioned to hearing pop music in a certain way. And I don't do it that way.\n20191\n0\n20192\n0\n20193\n0\n20194\n0\n20195\n0\n20196\n0\n20197\n0\n20198\n0\n20199\n0\n20200\nWe're social animals. We've got to get along together. It's in our nature. We're hardwired that way.\n20201\nJust stand up for your principals and be loyal to your friends and family.\n20202\n0\n20203\n0\n20204\n0\n20205\nI'm tired of hearing all this talk from people who don't understand the process of hard work-like little kids in the back seat asking 'Are we there yet?' Get where you're going 1 mile-marker at a time.\n20206\n0\n20207\n0\n20208\n0\n20209\n0\n20210\n0\n20211\n0\n20212\n0\n20213\n0\n20214\nFor years, I never really pondered how I came to be a writer from where I came from.\n20215\n0\n20216\n0\n20217\nIn life you have a choice: Bitter or Better? Choose better, forget bitter.\n20218\n0\n20219\n0\n20220\n0\n20221\n0\n20222\n0\n20223\n0\n20224\n0\n20225\n0\n20226\nThe people that are inclined to hate are also inclined to belosers. A loser could never congratulate a winner – it’s not in them\n20227\n0\n20228\n0\n20229\n0\n20230\n0\n20231\nPeople may hurt you but God will heal you. People may humiliate you but God will honour you. People may judge you but God will justify you.\n20232\n0\n20233\n0\n20234\n0\n20235\n0\n20236\n0\n20237\n0\n20238\n0\n20239\n0\n20240\n0\n20241\nFamily is so important and I think that is what you are doing in a relationship - you are in one way or another creating a family. And if you don't have a solid base for that, then it is never going to work.\n20242\n0\n20243\nMy mom was my muse - she would buy me Italian 'Vogue.' I was this little fashion boy.\n20244\n0\n20245\n0\n20246\n0\n20247\n0\n20248\n0\n20249\n0\n20250\n0\n20251\n0\n20252\n0\n20253\nI guess it would fall into the stalker category more or less. I was being stalked by a mime - silent but maybe deadly. Somehow, this mime would appear on the set of 'Bringing Out the Dead' and start doing strange things. I have no idea how it got past security. Finally, the producers took some action and I haven't seen the mime since. But it was definitely unsettling.\n20254\n0\n20255\n0\n20256\n0\n20257\nThat's what I think when people do their \"best stuff\" collection. When you start to think, \"Oh, I will just present my 10 years of work,\" that's not a good sign.\n20258\n0\n20259\n0\n20260\n0\n20261\n0\n20262\n0\n20263\nThere was a village watercolour society and they'd come and paint in my field. I watched them from the window, the way they would struggle this way and that to find the perfect moment. God has made every angle on that beautiful, and I felt that tremendously.\n20264\n0\n20265\nI think that experiencing through art is a wonderful way to expand the horizon and everything around it.\n20266\n0\n20267\n0\n20268\nNot just as a black woman, but as a woman, since the beginning of time, beauty has been our responsibility.\n20269\n0\n20270\n0\n20271\n0\n20272\n0\n20273\n0\n20274\n0\n20275\n0\n20276\n0\n20277\nThe stories that I want to tell are completely, well somewhat autobiographical. It's completely based on my own self-absorption issues and problems.\n20278\nEven as a child I had a strong relationship with yearning and desire. And loss. Those things spoke to me.\n20279\nPerhaps that is what it means to be a father - to teach your child to live without you.\n20280\n0\n20281\n0\n20282\n0\n20283\n[My favorite thing about motherhood is] that it's made me grow into a woman finally, and I finally grew up, thank God.\n20284\nI've always been someone who's extremely relaxed in my everyday life. I'm not the girl who can wear awful seven-inch heels all night. I keep it simple - I consider myself to be a jeans and T-shirt kind of girl who just accessorizes a lot.\n20285\n0\n20286\n0\n20287\n0\n20288\n0\n20289\n0\n20290\n0\n20291\n0\n20292\nI didn't marry a man that wanted to be in the business. But that's why we're a perfect fit.\n20293\n0\n20294\n0\n20295\n0\n20296\n0\n20297\n0\n20298\n0\n20299\n0\n20300\nThis is taking place inside Europe. This is taking place inside a once great nation. The nation that invented democracy. We are on the edge of total social breakdown. And frankly, as far as the euro is concerned and the austerity measures are concerned, the medicine is killing the patient.\n20301\n0\n20302\n0\n20303\n0\n20304\n0\n20305\n0\n20306\n0\n20307\n0\n20308\n0\n20309\n0\n20310\n0\n20311\n0\n20312\n0\n20313\n0\n20314\n0\n20315\n0\n20316\n0\n20317\n0\n20318\n0\n20319\n0\n20320\n0\n20321\n0\n20322\n0\n20323\n0\n20324\n0\n20325\nI am someone who places great value on the detail. That was always the case, even in my days as a racing driver.\n20326\n0\n20327\n0\n20328\n0\n20329\n0\n20330\n0\n20331\n0\n20332\n0\n20333\n0\n20334\n0\n20335\nI am a huge fan of the Black woman. I never hesitate to recommend her when times are bad or things go wrong.\n20336\n0\n20337\n0\n20338\nWhat we are is serious. And you see us in action, so it's not in personas. It's in actions and it's what we do. And that's why Russia was left on an island when it came to Syria. Everyone else isolated them with their connection with Bashar Assad and Iran.\n20339\n0\n20340\nMy love for animals started before I can remember.\n20341\n0\n20342\nRaw and honest is what I go for [in my style of shooting]. I am looking for your inner beauty. The outside tells a story... But together is raw honesty.\n20343\n0\n20344\n0\n20345\n0\n20346\n0\n20347\n0\n20348\n0\n20349\n0\n20350\n0\n20351\n0\n20352\nIt feels like my job is to support people. I support great artists. When I worked with a symphony, I sat in the third chair, not the first chair.\n20353\n0\n20354\n0\n20355\n0\n20356\nI'm always trying to do something active because I love it.\n20357\n0\n20358\nI see something new in 'Gosford Park' every time I watch it.\n20359\n0\n20360\n0\n20361\n0\n20362\n0\n20363\nThere's just something about vampires that's sexy...It's the same reason why women go for the bad boy - you want them but you shouldn't have them.\n20364\n0\n20365\n0\n20366\n0\n20367\n0\n20368\n0\n20369\n0\n20370\n0\n20371\n0\n20372\n0\n20373\n0\n20374\n0\n20375\nIt's important for women to understand that it's bad enough that we don't make dollar-for-dollar what men do, but when you distill that down to women of color, our Latinas and our African American women, it's even less than that 78 cents.\n20376\n0\n20377\n0\n20378\nA lot of artists come into the game with a radio record, but they don't establish the fans as fans of their style of music. It's just that they're a fan of that song, and after that song plays out, it's real hard for 'em.\n20379\n0\n20380\n0\n20381\n0\n20382\n0\n20383\n0\n20384\n0\n20385\n0\n20386\n0\n20387\n0\n20388\nIt's kind of major, learning to drive. I feel like it kicked up other stuff in my life.\n20389\n0\n20390\n0\n20391\n0\n20392\n0\n20393\n0\n20394\n0\n20395\n0\n20396\n0\n20397\n0\n20398\n0\n20399\n0\n20400\n0\n20401\nAnyone who studies declassified documents soon becomes aware that government secrecy is largely an effort to protect policy makers from scrutiny by citizens, not to protect the country from enemies.\n20402\n0\n20403\n0\n20404\nI don't know anyone who would be exclusively working on game music, per se.\n20405\n0\n20406\n0\n20407\nI'm always writing, but directing takes priority over everything, unless the acting is a job that lifts that whole brand. If I get a part in a big film with a big director and I was going to direct one of my one films, I would take the former job because that job will only help anything that I then intend to do. I think in the long run, directing is the thing that will outlive everything else. Maybe that and writing.\n20408\nMy mum and dad are both really funny. My granddad's really funny, my uncle's really funny, everyone's really funny. You have to be quick, otherwise you get roasted. Everyone takes the piss quite a lot. You have to be really sharp.\n20409\n0\n20410\nYou can have it all but how much do you want it?\n20411\n0\n20412\n0\n20413\n0\n20414\n0\n20415\n0\n20416\n0\n20417\nI just want the future to happen faster. I can't imagine the future without robots.\n20418\n0\n20419\n0\n20420\n0\n20421\n0\n20422\n0\n20423\n0\n20424\n0\n20425\n0\n20426\n0\n20427\nI always push myself, even when I did a film where it was pretty much me the whole film.\n20428\n0\n20429\n0\n20430\nIn all the illusions, you're the only truth that I need\n20431\n0\n20432\nI like songs with a lot of heart and feeling and subtlety.\n20433\n0\n20434\n0\n20435\n0\n20436\n0\n20437\n0\n20438\n0\n20439\n0\n20440\n0\n20441\n0\n20442\nHypocrisy is the outward acknowledgment of inward shame.\n20443\n0\n20444\n0\n20445\n0\n20446\n0\n20447\n0\n20448\n0\n20449\n0\n20450\nGiven the nonsense that is turned out daily by the Holocaust industry, the wonder is that there are so few skeptics.\n20451\n0\n20452\n0\n20453\n0\n20454\n0\n20455\n0\n20456\n0\n20457\n0\n20458\nI guess because the shows were activist in their own way - the marriage of my public activism and my career activism, you know - people understand me very well. They also understand there's a very strong bipartisan part in all of this.\n20459\n0\n20460\n0\n20461\n0\n20462\n0\n20463\nYou can't not look cool with a crossbow.\n20464\n0\n20465\n0\n20466\n0\n20467\n0\n20468\n0\n20469\n0\n20470\n0\n20471\n0\n20472\n0\n20473\n0\n20474\n0\n20475\n0\n20476\n0\n20477\n0\n20478\n0\n20479\n0\n20480\n0\n20481\nMy father had never watched tennis, never liked tennis too much. He said, 'OK, we buy a racket, we watch together,' because we didn't know anything. It was a process of learning together that made it more interesting.\n20482\n0\n20483\n0\n20484\n0\n20485\n0\n20486\n0\n20487\n0\n20488\n0\n20489\n0\n20490\n0\n20491\n0\n20492\n0\n20493\n0\n20494\n0\n20495\n0\n20496\n0\n20497\n0\n20498\nLet's just say that I have a tendency if I am uncomfortable in a situation to speak my mind.\n20499\n0\n20500\n0\n20501\n0\n20502\n0\n20503\n0\n20504\n0\n20505\n0\n20506\n0\n20507\n0\n20508\n0\n20509\n0\n20510\n0\n20511\n0\n20512\n0\n20513\n0\n20514\n0\n20515\n0\n20516\nIf I have the choice of traveling to Russia, India or New Zealand alone for a week for preliminary discussions or to spend that week with my family, I routinely choose my family.\n20517\n0\n20518\n0\n20519\n0\n20520\n0\n20521\n0\n20522\n0\n20523\n0\n20524\n0\n20525\n0\n20526\n0\n20527\n0\n20528\nI just went to an acting agency one day and just said, 'I would like to act. Would you take me?' And they took me.\n20529\n0\n20530\n0\n20531\n0\n20532\n0\n20533\n0\n20534\nWhen you look at our programme for the next few weeks, you do not fancy a trip to the Oktoberfest.\n20535\n0\n20536\n0\n20537\n0\n20538\n0\n20539\n0\n20540\nForget the grand plan. Forget the master scheme. Forget control. That is the bleak but true basis of independent cinema. Inch by motherfuking inch we must, because we have no other choice.\n20541\n0\n20542\n0\n20543\n0\n20544\n0\n20545\n0\n20546\n0\n20547\n0\n20548\n0\n20549\n0\n20550\n0\n20551\nHow many of you have had a crush on a teacher? I mean, remember that Physics professor? Law One is so steamy, I'm getting worked up just thinking about it: Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it. Mee-yow.\n20552\nI do have high standards, but I don't expect anything from anyone that I don't expect from myself.\n20553\nOf course I love leather, and I love stingray. So combining the two and adding those gold elements - I always love a great gold accessory.\n20554\n0\n20555\nI did 'Nobody Walks' right after 'Dredd.' Well, actually, I got off the plane from Capetown where we shot 'Dredd' and tested for 'Being Flynn' that same day. Then I came out to L.A. to make this film right after that so it was all very back to back.\n20556\nI think my confidence has developed over the years, in terms of the speed at which I will reveal how collaborative I want to be.\n20557\nI hope I never get in the situation where I refuse to audition, because I think people have a right to see you interpreting the character, and if you don't do it the way they want you to, they have a right to say, \"No.\"\n20558\n0\n20559\n0\n20560\n0\n20561\nAn actor cannot say no, it’s against his job. If he wants the part he has to say yes. [But] it’s very bad for you to say you can do something and then not do it, so you have to manage to do it.\n20562\n0\n20563\nEven if I'm the youngest in the group, I'm the one taking care of everybody. I'm always in control, which means that I can see what everyone around me is doing, what they're going to do. At the end of the day, I make sure to never let go of that control.\n20564\n0\n20565\nI am not a designer that buys vintage to be inspired.\n20566\n0\n20567\n0\n20568\n0\n20569\n0\n20570\n0\n20571\n0\n20572\n0\n20573\n0\n20574\n0\n20575\nA lot of directors are overbearing and tend to make you doubt your instincts.\n20576\n0\n20577\n0\n20578\n0\n20579\n0\n20580\n0\n20581\n0\n20582\n0\n20583\n0\n20584\n0\n20585\n0\n20586\n0\n20587\n0\n20588\n0\n20589\nI choose to rise up out of that storm and see that in moments of desperation, fear, and helplessness, each of us can be a rainbow of hope, doing what we can to extend ourselves in kindness and grace to one another. And I know for sure that there is no them - there's only us.\n20590\n0\n20591\nI think you can blame certain police officers for certain behavior, you can blame certain departments for certain behavior, and power and so forth, but, ultimately, I'd say it's about us, and it's about society, and I say - even if its sounds a little controversial - put the police aside for a second. It's really not about them. It's about the game that's been created to keep the status quo going and to let the people who own it all gain from the game.\n20592\nI've been having a lot of fun exploring different aspects of filmmaking, like writing and producing. There isn't a specific plan and I usually don't know what's going to be the next thing I do.\n20593\nWhen we lose people we love, we should never disturb their souls, whether living or dead. Instead. we should find consolation in an object that reminds you of them, something...I don't know...even an earring\n20594\n0\n20595\n0\n20596\n0\n20597\n0\n20598\n0\n20599\n0\n20600\n0\n20601\n0\n20602\n0\n20603\n0\n20604\n0\n20605\n0\n20606\n0\n20607\n0\n20608\nWe cannot let our respect for the FBI blind us from the fact the FBI has sometimes come up short of our expectations.\n20609\n0\n20610\nFaith doesn't mean you never doubt. It only means you never act upon your doubts.\n20611\n0\n20612\nHow ironic for peacemaking efforts to discover that hatred is stronger for many than love; that the longing to achieve power through military victories makes so many men lose their reason, forget all shame, and betray history.\n20613\n0\n20614\n0\n20615\n0\n20616\n0\n20617\n0\n20618\n0\n20619\n0\n20620\n0\n20621\n0\n20622\n0\n20623\n0\n20624\n0\n20625\n0\n20626\n0\n20627\n0\n20628\n0\n20629\n0\n20630\n0\n20631\n0\n20632\n0\n20633\n0\n20634\n0\n20635\n0\n20636\n0\n20637\n0\n20638\n0\n20639\n0\n20640\n0\n20641\n0\n20642\n0\n20643\n0\n20644\n0\n20645\n0\n20646\nActing is more fun than writing.

So that was really tragic. That put the whole project on the shelf.\n20660\n[Malcolm Subban] is probably winning the battle cause we had a couple skates together and I didn't score too much on him.

I concluded it's the baby ordering in. Prenatal takeout. Even without ever being in a restaurant, fetuses develop remarkably discerning palates, and they are not shy about demanding what they want. If they get a hankering, they just pick up the umbilical cord and call. 'You know what would taste good right now? A cheeseburger, large fries, and a vanilla shake. And if you could, hurry it up, because I'm supposed to grow a lung in a half hour.'\n21106\nI take having a kids' show real seriously.

It is not defined, as are the western and gangster genres, by conventions of setting and conflict, but rather by the more subtle qualities of tone and mood.

Then he would very sensitively respond - \"Well, have you thought about?\" or \"Might you consider?\" I respected that so much because I thought he was so sensitive to my work, and didn't want to offend me, but in the right way to encourage me.\n21134\n0\n21135\n0\n21136\n0\n21137\nI had heard some women make comments about my chest, so why not show it off?

You just kind of put your polish and sheen on it, and you're interpretation of it, but it's very much the agency's idea.\n21154\n0\n21155\nThat fact is that we live in an extremely violent culture, and we all justify violence if it's for what we believe in .\n21156\nToday, we're even into the whole sweat thing. They'll wear a [suit] jacket like this, but they'll wear it with sweat pants and sneakers. But I do think there is every generation - and it won't be as big as it was when you and I were those ages - but every generation all of a sudden experiences that they want to dress up.\n21157\n0\n21158\nThere is that unpredictability of the seasons that I enjoy.

We need to rely on a support network and bring more cohesion to different filmmakers, actors, producers etc. It's a very difficult business.

In the old days I used to reach for the tissues, until I realized that passing a person a tissue may be just another way to shut them down, to take them out of their experience of sadness and grief.

One day, I'll do a power yoga or hot yoga day, and then go into a more intense day of HIIT training or boxing.

Because if you look at the early '80s hip hop, it was so much creativity goin' on with artists like then, like Slick Rick, then you had Rakim, and you had these different kind of artists back then. And we was a marble cake of all these artists. So I didn't have a problem with writin' stories because I felt like that was somethin' I loved to do.

It seems to be an art of recognizing the role of the unforeseen, of keeping your balance amid surprises, of collaborating with chance, of recognizing that there are some essential mysteries in the world and thereby a limit to calculation, to plan, to control. To calculate on the unforeseen is perhaps exactly the paradoxical operation that life most requires of us.\n22248\nI believe that marriage is a representation of Christ and the church and when Christ and the church are unified, they are the strongest and most attractive to those that don't know Jesus.\n22249\nLike when that man was running down Broadway stark naked and we all had to eat in the cafeteria while the police tried to catch him.\n22250\n0\n22251\n0\n22252\n0\n22253\n0\n22254\n0\n22255\n0\n22256\nMy American accent is really, really good.

You've caught the rhythm of them once and for all, in your sleep at night. The city, of course, can wreck it. So much insomnia. So many rhythms collide. The salesgirl, the landlord, the guests, the bystanders, sixteen varieties of social circumstance in a day. Everyone has the power to call your whole life into question here.

But after a while, you pick up the rug and there's just way too much dirt, so you might as well\n just be up front about it.\n22756\n0\n22757\n0\n22758\n0\n22759\n0\n22760\n0\n22761\n0\n22762\n0\n22763\n0\n22764\nWe will miss George for his sense of love, his sense of music and his sense of laughter.\n22765\n0\n22766\n0\n22767\n0\n22768\n0\n22769\n0\n22770\n0\n22771\nI prefer to explore the most intimate moments, the smaller, crystallized details we all hinge our lives on.\n22772\n0\n22773\n0\n22774\nLeroy bet me I couldn't find a pot of gold at the end, and I told him that was a stupid bet because the rainbow was enough.\n22775\nI'm trying, now that I am in my dotage, to use a lot less sugar and my husband and I really try to keep close to a minimum of fat; chicken, fish, loads of salads and legumes. We both love all of those. To be honest, nothing that is in our diet is that original. We eat seafood but we do not eat shellfish. On the other hand, if my body says to me, \"eat meat\" I do. I listen to my body, I think that's important.\n22776\nI have had young fascinations but never love.\n22777\nBuying something on sale is a very special feeling. In fact, the less I pay for something, the more it is worth to me. I have a dress that I paid so little for that I am afraid to wear it. I could spill something on it, and then how would I replace it for that amount of money?\n22778\n0\n22779\n0\n22780\n0\n22781\n0\n22782\nI see someone like John Williams, the classical player, and the amount of discipline and the natural ability that man has is so frightening. That requires so much natural talent.

When we saw [Richie Faulkner] play, we thought, \"We don't have to tell this guy anything.

The average kindergartner probably doesn't know about it, except that in Massachusetts, you do, because they'll take you on field trips to see reenactments and stuff.\n22843\n0\n22844\n0\n22845\n0\n22846\n0\n22847\n0\n22848\nIt sounds mercenary and it smacks of rats leaving the sinking ship.

I'm a big fan of Netflix and I get films from them all the time. If I hear about something that I don't know, that I haven't seen, forgot about, I immediately jot it down and add it to my Netflix list or if there's a film that's available that I haven't seen for many years, I get that.\n22882\n0\n22883\n0\n22884\n0\n22885\n0\n22886\n0\n22887\nEverybody thought New York was this hard, cruel place, and I found it to be an extraordinarily wonderful place filled with the most interesting people.\n22888\n0\n22889\nI use the phrase 'sibling society' to suggest a culture fundamentally without fathers, mothers, grandfathers, grandmothers, or ancestors. The thinking is horizontal.\n22890\n0\n22891\n0\n22892\nThe claim that myth is always a narrative spin-off of ritual; the claim that myth is the projection of human anxieties onto a cosmological scrim; the claim that myths are invented to give sanction to human predilections and institutions... These are ways of trivializing a mode of thought that has served humanity well for a very long time.\n22893\n0\n22894\n0\n22895\n0\n22896\n0\n22897\n0\n22898\n0\n22899\nGuys, particularly in the West, go to the gym and train for hours and hours to pick up something that is heavier than them.

I mean he's up there with Muhammad Ali, as far as I'm concerned. His humanitarian work, his contribution to the world and music - he's really an amazing man. Even political divides don't affect his humanity. So, to me, that was extremely meaningful.\n22927\n0\n22928\n0\n22929\nA lot of young actors have the idea that, \"I've got to do this right.  There's a right way to do this.\"  But there's no right or wrong. There's only good and bad.  And \"bad\" usually happens when you're trying too hard to do it right. There's a very broad spectrum of things that can inhibit you. The most important thing for actors - and not just actors, but everybody - is to feel loose enough to create what you want to create, and be free to try anything. To have choices.\n22930\n0\n22931\nThe Odyssey and Iliad say things about the human condition in ways we should re-acquaint ourselves with, and use as a prism to interpret though.\n22932\n0\n22933\n0\n22934\n0\n22935\nI've always felt that if you're not on your side, why should anyone else be.

The economics are compelling. The public health is compelling. Why would we maintain a focus on a 17th-century technology, when there are 21st-century alternatives that are both necessary and available? And the answer is the subversion of democracy.\n22949\n0\n22950\n0\n22951\nAnd it's true, you hear things in Damascus and, after a few hours, the human double-take stops operating.\n22952\n0\n22953\n0\n22954\n0\n22955\n0\n22956\n0\n22957\n0\n22958\n0\n22959\n0\n22960\nOnce I started getting mainstream people to my shows, I realized we were taking too many solos, and they were too long.

You may feel you are helping the drowning man but you are precipitating your own disaster. The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead.\n22966\n0\n22967\nI just try to make sure every day that I'm blessed to live on this earth that I seize that day. I'm 25 and, you know, I know with each passing second, I'm getting older. So, I might well seize every single one of those seconds and make sure I'm doing as much as I possibly can in the community to know we worked hard for this and to instill that into everybody around me is truly my goal.\n22968\n0\n22969\n0\n22970\nWhen people bump up against one another in the course of pursuing their goals, it is in everyone's interest to resolve any resulting problems in the least costly ways possible.\n22971\n0\n22972\n0\n22973\n0\n22974\n0\n22975\nThere's very little solid research on readership, yet people make pronouncements about it all the time.\n22976\n0\n22977\n0\n22978\n0\n22979\n0\n22980\n0\n22981\n0\n22982\n0\n22983\n0\n22984\n0\n22985\n0\n22986\n0\n22987\n0\n22988\nI created 'Dinner: Impossible' with a guy named Bryan O'Reilly and I shot the pilot as a 30 minute show and we sold it.\n22989\n0\n22990\n0\n22991\n0\n22992\n0\n22993\n0\n22994\n0\n22995\nAs I write in 2012 we certainly do not believe that it is over yet, and the worst may be yet to come. Efforts by governments to solve the underlying problems responsible for the crisis have still not gotten very far, and the 'stress tests' that governments have used to encourage optimism about our financial institutions were of questionable thoroughness.\n22996\n0\n22997\n0\n22998\n0\n22999\nWhen different generations of cars are combined into one train, it messes with the loudspeaker system.\n23000\n0\n23001\nEvery adult in the world has some sense that he or she might be obliterated at any time by these weapons that we have created.\n23002\nI share five scriptural insights that lead me to the conclusion that those who are incapable of trusting in Christ on their own are still welcomed into heaven the same way you and I are welcomed into heaven: by the grace of God.\n23003\n0\n23004\n0\n23005\n0\n23006\n0\n23007\n0\n23008\n0\n23009\n0\n23010\n0\n23011\n0\n23012\n0\n23013\n0\n23014\nI don't mean to sound sexist, but as far as women have come over the last 40 years, you don't really see a lot of women hunters. They're still in the minority in the military, and there's not a lot of female construction workers. I hope that's not taken the wrong way. I think women are as smart, resourceful, and capable in most things as any man could be … but they are generally physically weaker.

We also wanted to buy in a lower rent area that looked like it was going to be gentrified so that we could eventually sell the studio for more money.\n23284\n0\n23285\n0\n23286\n0\n23287\n0\n23288\n0\n23289\n0\n23290\n0\n23291\n0\n23292\n0\n23293\n0\n23294\n0\n23295\n0\n23296\nI'm very fortunate, and I know that.\n23297\n0\n23298\n0\n23299\n0\n23300\nThe capacity to become aware of the givens of our existence - such as change - and to actually welcome those as just part of our human experience releases the struggle.\n23301\n0\n23302\n0\n23303\n0\n23304\n0\n23305\n0\n23306\n0\n23307\n0\n23308\n0\n23309\n0\n23310\n0\n23311\n0\n23312\n0\n23313\n0\n23314\n0\n23315\n0\n23316\n0\n23317\n0\n23318\n0\n23319\n0\n23320\nI think many Dutch just don't know the history of Black Pete, that he is rooted in slavery, and how he was used to dehumanize a race of people.

Cold comfort for change? And did you exchange A walk on part in the war For a lead role in a cage? How I wish, how I wish you were here.

We do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make up for our mistakes, neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how to live, so long as we aren’t infringing on their rights. Freedom to make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones. If we are only free to make good decisions, we are not really free.\n23425\n0\n23426\nAs an actor or anybody as a human being, I feel more and more like I want to spend time doing something significant.

You have to have some basic creative spark, and then, if you have that, I feel like you can learn the production side of it. You can learn how to be a good producer.

But you can't take it personally - they probably do it to everyone.\n23474\nTraining has always been a hobby, and my whole life has revolved around training. It's something I truly love doing.

I'm not saying you should never do the laundry, or pay attention to the kids, but for most of us, we're not present to how much time we spend on those. Anything that wastes your time is a waste of money.\n23504\n0\n23505\n0\n23506\n0\n23507\nThe positive outlook that optimists project does not come from ignoring or denying problems. Optimists simply assume that problems are temporary and can be solved, so optimists naturally want more information about problems because then they can get to work and do something. Pessimists are more likely to believe that there is nothing they can do anyway, so what's the point of even thinking about it?\n23508\n0\n23509\n0\n23510\n0\n23511\n0\n23512\n0\n23513\nNothing can teach you what it's like to work on a film set, and the best education there can be for an actor is to walk up the street and observe human nature.\n23514\n0\n23515\n0\n23516\nI needed to carve out my own place and find out what I was going to do\n23517\nWe're really delving into so many stories that are comic book based, so I like that we have a woman as part of that production. We haven't really explored that too much. Wonder Woman has had so many different connotations over the years because she's so beloved as a character, and it's been interesting to see how she's evolved - to see how her outfits have changed, and going from having her invisible plane to starting to fly herself, and sort of be on par with the physical attributes of Superman.\n23518\n0\n23519\n0\n23520\n0\n23521\nHere in L.A. the standard of beauty is kind of ridiculous. I want to be doing this when I'm in my fifties and sixties and this isn't what I'm going to look like.\n23522\n0\n23523\nHollywood is all about making an entrance. I don't want to be a walking advertisement for anyone other than myself.\n23524\n0\n23525\n0\n23526\n0\n23527\nHumanity is a failed experiment, but I think I'm God and I'd like to start over. I don't want to die, I just want everyone else to. I certainly would not be lonely. It would be exciting never having to listen to another person again but just my own self droning on and on. That's why I write a blog.

They were involved and invested and helpful. One took me into her family and loved me back to life. She taught me that love is not formed and families are not formed by blood. That love makes a family.\n23548\n0\n23549\n0\n23550\n0\n23551\nThe idea of a post-religious society is a fantasy, ultimately.

I guess I do allow myself to explore more when I know that, at the end of the day, if I really wanted to, I could just play a different person all day and be fine with that.\n23566\n0\n23567\n0\n23568\n0\n23569\n0\n23570\n0\n23571\n0\n23572\n0\n23573\n0\n23574\n0\n23575\n0\n23576\n0\n23577\nMozart combined high formality and playfulness that delights as no other composition in any other medium does.\n23578\nOne of the challenges of any second-term administration is you always lose a certain amount of identification with the Congress, because everybody in the Congress in the first term knows you'll be out there in the next campaign with them, ..

They're what we need economically, and I think they're what we need morally... [They] revitalize America and get it back to its sense of confidence... All of these immigrants that come here help us with the work they do, they challenge us with new ideas and new perspectives, and they give us perspective.\n23636\n0\n23637\n0\n23638\n0\n23639\n0\n23640\n0\n23641\n0\n23642\n0\n23643\nMy career has suddenly started to be the one that I'd always wanted, not in terms of level of success, but in terms of - and this is what I've been banging on about - playing different parts in different media. I was very frustrated, in a physical sense, by people seeing me in a way that I wasn't. And I was beginning to find myself boxed into a corner. Hopefully things have loosed up a bit, and I've gotten better and become more relaxed as an actor.\n23644\nI've developed into quite a swan. I'm one of those people that will probably look better and better as I get older - until I drop dead of beauty.\n23645\n0\n23646\n0\n23647\n0\n23648\n0\n23649\nFor a while I thought about studying medicine at school and becoming a doctor because I've always been interested in psychology and how people's minds operate. But I'm able to explore some of that as an actor and ultimately I think it seems more interesting.\n23650\n0\n23651\nWe as gay people get to choose our family and the people we're around. I am your family. We are a family here.\n23652\n0\n23653\n0\n23654\nI can only go places because I know that I can go away from them, if that makes sense. I like the gypsy lifestyle that filming affords.\n23655\n0\n23656\nToo bad brooms can't really fly. Now if you miss the bus you can't just go in your room and fly to school with a nimbus two thousand!\n23657\n0\n23658\nYou can't build a strong corporation with a lot of committees and a board that has to be consulted every turn.

A liberal will interpret the constitution, a conservative will quote it!\n23666\nBut the trees seemed to know me. They whispered among themselves and beckoned me nearer. And looking around, I noticed the other small trees and wild plants and grasses had sprung up under the protection of the trees we had placed there. The trees had multiplied! They were moving. In one small corner of the world, Grandfather's dream was coming true and the trees were moving again.\n23667\n0\n23668\n0\n23669\nHealth care for all Americans is the most pressing domestic issue today.

It's nice, that. To have achieved sudden intimacy with strangers is perhaps the most human thing you can do. We all love our friends and families, as much as we hate them. When you can achieve intimacy with strangers, it's very exciting and heartening.\n23679\n0\n23680\nI have a new horse. I get her to come to me from half a mile away. With just a simple call. That's because she knows that when she's with me, she's taken care of.

Just by nature of writing a poem you are taking the time to dwell on whatever it is that you're writing about...you can be celebrating anger, you can be celebrating sorrow... you are spending the time to focus and observe and try to understand the various parts of being human.\n24126\n0\n24127\n0\n24128\n0\n24129\n0\n24130\nYou plan to be a challenge, do you?\" Juliana smiled angelically. \"I agreed to remain, my lord.

The physical stuff's great and I think it's great as an actor because you get to live a lot of little lives, but learning more about the world, learning another language, continuing with my Spanish that's important.\n24231\n0\n24232\n0\n24233\n0\n24234\n0\n24235\n0\n24236\n0\n24237\n0\n24238\n0\n24239\nI'm way more comfortable around kids than I am people my own age.\n24240\n0\n24241\n0\n24242\n0\n24243\n0\n24244\n0\n24245\n0\n24246\n0\n24247\n0\n24248\n0\n24249\n0\n24250\n0\n24251\n0\n24252\n0\n24253\nI don't even know who that person was in the '80s.

They'll suffer for it and die for it and watch their friends die for it, but in the end, it will get done. That only means that society should be careful about what it asks for. ... Soldiers themselves are reluctant to evaluate the costs of war, but someone must.

That was all criminal activity. With these guys, we're not talking about the kind of common crimes that Nixon committed. I can't tell you whether they are technically breaking the law, but basically, the American government has been hijacked by neoconservatives. They are taking an awful lot of national security operations into the White House.\n24473\nWhy does one need a doctor if God has given us our body and we pray to Him for our help?\n24474\n0\n24475\n0\n24476\n0\n24477\n0\n24478\n0\n24479\n0\n24480\n0\n24481\n0\n24482\n0\n24483\n0\n24484\n0\n24485\n0\n24486\n0\n24487\n0\n24488\n0\n24489\n0\n24490\n0\n24491\nAs a teenager, my struggle was how do I balance being empathetic and compassionate towards my peers, while also living my life for myself and not basing my decisions on those around me, and really living a life where I receive my happiness from my own experiences rather than from people pleasing.\n24492\n0\n24493\n0\n24494\nBecause of you, I'm running out of reasons to cry.\n24495\nWork and play can be the same. When you are following your energy and doing what you want to do all the time, the distinction between work and play dissolves. Work is no longer what you have to do, and play what you want to do.

So there's still some debate in the field.\n24669\nYou know, I just don't believe that art is supposed to make sense. I really don't think it's supposed to be analyzed to death.

But it's almost like society in general considers video games to be something of a nuisance, that they want to toss into the garbage can.\n24728\n0\n24729\n0\n24730\n0\n24731\n0\n24732\n0\n24733\n0\n24734\n0\n24735\n0\n24736\n0\n24737\n0\n24738\n0\n24739\n0\n24740\n0\n24741\nWhat is important is that one utilizes one's intellect and not to be 100 percent sure about one's convictions.

I'm not worried about that.

But to see that Africans are the hardest hit by climate change, even though they generate almost no greenhouse gas, is a glaring injustice, which also triggers anger and outrage over those who seek to ignore it.\n24808\n0\n24809\n0\n24810\nMy father was always very interested in space. I watch Star Trek and all those things, but I always had a different picture in my mind... maybe closer to Alien.

It is even more true in creative fields already considered to be \"squishy\" and feminine, and it's a big problem because great women have been left off the record.\n24897\n0\n24898\n0\n24899\nI wanted to put all my family stories down for my girls, and I remember everything so vividly.

Whatever it is you do you have to master your craft.\n24939\n0\n24940\nI just remember seventh grade as being really difficult, because there's nothing meaner than a girl at that age. You gang up on people, and it's traumatic. It wasn't so bad for me, but there's a woman I know who's still traumatized by junior high. At that age, everything seems like a huge deal, but of course that changes when you get older.\n24941\n0\n24942\n0\n24943\n0\n24944\nI understand English; I read and write English perfectly, but the accent won't go away.\n24945\n0\n24946\n0\n24947\n0\n24948\n0\n24949\nMy parents only played Isley Brothers, Marvin Gaye.

So from old school to '90s to recent, it's just always been there.\n24950\nPeople will say you cannot get a job in a down economy. People will say you cannot get a job that you love that will pay you well. People will say you can’t do good and do well. They’re wrong, that’s idiotic advice.

I believe something is happening, I'm not sure what it is.\n24970\n0\n24971\n0\n24972\n0\n24973\nBut if I didn't have to make money, I would still play my horn.\n24974\n0\n24975\nThroughout the whole Stroll album, I'm breaking barriers. Whether I'm doing acoustic hip-hop, singing my own hooks or singing my own verses...

If Maurice was anxious about it, then I would be petrified.\n25024\nA spine to my films that's become more evident to me is that many are about the choices people make, and the reverberations of those choices. You go this way, or that way, and either way, there's going to be consequences.\n25025\n0\n25026\n0\n25027\nI don't know how many records I'm selling.\n25028\n0\n25029\n0\n25030\n0\n25031\n0\n25032\n0\n25033\n0\n25034\n0\n25035\n0\n25036\n0\n25037\n0\n25038\n0\n25039\n0\n25040\n0\n25041\n0\n25042\n0\n25043\n0\n25044\nI won a dancing contest to get into wrestling.

I don't think anything can really beat the pure fun and pleasure of holding a magazine in your hand, reading the story on paper, being able to roll it up and put it in your pocket, reread again later, show it to a friend, carry it with you, toss it on a shelf, collect them, have a lot of magazines lined up and read them again as a series.

Green bananas created a pattern against a background of yellow bananas spelling out the sentiment: Self-confidence produces fine results.

When the yellow background bananas turned brown, the type (and the self-confidence) appeared again, only to go away when all bananas turned brown.\n25108\n0\n25109\n0\n25110\n0\n25111\n0\n25112\n0\n25113\n0\n25114\n0\n25115\n0\n25116\n0\n25117\n0\n25118\n0\n25119\nI didn't want to be thirtysomething and not know what I was going to do.

They just like somebody that can give them purpose.\n25177\n0\n25178\nUsed books are the sluts of the literary world.

You do get writer's block when you're writing music, and having inspiration from other great writers is great.

This feels as extreme as that, and that's really liberating. It's really liberating to just go 180 from what my life is like. I love that! I love not having to think about clothes. I wanted to wear a uniform when I was in high school, but I couldn't. I was like, \"It would be so much easier!\"\n26051\nFeel good about being someone who loves selflessly.

The relationship between the press and the Clinton White House during the later period was not a healthy one. There was a lot of hostility and a lot of suspicion. This administration has done systematically what no other administration had done. They came in with a corporate mentality, an ability to stay on script that was without parallel.\n26070\n0\n26071\n0\n26072\nEvery time somebody writes a theory about where literature's going, that person is not only contributing thought but nudging things to happen in one way or the other. Just as in painting, there's much more interest in the American scene painters and the early American... like the Ashcan school of painters. Who would have thought, 50 years ago, that Norman Rockwell would again be considered a serious painter? And yet, there are a lot of people who are saying Rockwell was a very accomplished technician. These things are constantly moving.\n26073\nI have been an unabashed fan of NPR for many years, and have stolen untold excellent ideas from its programming.\n26074\n0\n26075\n0\n26076\n0\n26077\nIt's almost weirder sometimes when you don't have a full life experience with someone's ups and downs, knowing what they've been through. Sometimes a loss that just comes out of left field rings in a very weird way when you have actually sort of relied on this small moment with this or that person, as a moment that actually has defined something for you in your life.\n26078\n0\n26079\n0\n26080\n0\n26081\n0\n26082\n0\n26083\n0\n26084\n0\n26085\n0\n26086\n0\n26087\n0\n26088\nTo show you how radical I am, I want carjackers dead.

And you're more aware of your actions your thoughts and how it will affect your family. And the families around your family. You have to be a lot more careful. But you also relax a little bit.

You know, to me it's like a church for music. You can sit down and really give yourself to the performance and be comfortable with good surroundings and a clean, quiet atmosphere.\n26162\n0\n26163\n0\n26164\n0\n26165\nBut think about how evil that is for one man to think that he's actually more valuable than a woman, because as a human being your worth is immeasurable.\n26166\n0\n26167\n0\n26168\n0\n26169\n0\n26170\n0\n26171\n0\n26172\n0\n26173\nA lot of people seem to get carried away that something that's made out of paper mâché is going to be better than not. And I always thought the original King Kong, that terrible little puppet with its hair going in all directions, was far more magical than Peter Jackson's incredibly beautifully rendered King Kong. So there's something to be said for a more primitive version of things. I think it's because it makes the audience work a little bit more, because you've got to invest it with life and reality, so I like doing that.\n26174\n0\n26175\nThe line changed my life 'cause I thought of some poor woman I hadn't even met walking around the United States or the world not knowing she's going to be beaten up by me and these kids, unborn, not knowing they were going to be born into the family of a child-beater just because I was.

It's not like the conductor in the symphony orchestra performance because he's standing in front of you waiving his arms. You now what he's doing. You don't know what the director is doing unless you know a lot about theater and even then you can only deduce it. You know it when you go to rehearsal. You really know it when they are rehearsing something of yours. I learned more in the rehearsals for The Letter than I have ever dreamed of know in the theater as a critic.

But I guess what I was trying to say is, if I said I would never laugh at this, you could probably dig around and find a situation where I did laugh. I try not to be a hypocrite with that one. I find when there's a controversy about someone saying something offensive, I usually take the angle of, \"Well, I don't know if that was offensive; it just wasn't funny.\" I generally don't gasp, \"Oh my God!\" I think people have been getting raked over the coals lately.\n26623\n0\n26624\n0\n26625\n0\n26626\n0\n26627\n0\n26628\n0\n26629\n0\n26630\nThat's where the inspiration was and so the more that you rewrite and the more you rewrite and the more the numbnuts are coming in to give you notes then the more problems you run into and the more it suddenly doesn't seem like the movie, the story, the characters changed, watered down and we don't have that with this.\n26631\n0\n26632\n0\n26633\nYou always feel like rock critics are frustrated musicians.

Who knows what the tide could bring?\n26726\nI wanted my dad to be proud of me, and I fell into acting because there wasn't anything else I could do, and in it I found a discipline that I wanted to keep coming back to, that I love and I learn about every day.\n26727\nI've always been for immigration reform; in 2007 I just didn't feel it had enough protections.\n26728\n0\n26729\n0\n26730\n0\n26731\n0\n26732\nAll acting is an act of imagination. You are simply conjuring up imaginary circumstances in your mind and responding truthfully to them.\n26733\nI meet people who are famous, and it's made me realise that fame has huge lifestyle disadvantages. I'm nervous about that. I don't want to become a celebrity.\n26734\n0\n26735\nI appear to be drawn to iconic characters and what they reflect back to our cultures.\n26736\n0\n26737\n0\n26738\n0\n26739\n0\n26740\n0\n26741\nYou can't lose the essence of a song.

You sit in your armchair and you watch it on the news and you return to your PlayStation. Or you get out in the streets and you make it. Like, when those Supreme Court justices, you know, legalize desegregation, it wasn't due to their infinite wisdom. It's because people whose names you do not read about in history books, people whose faces you will never see, were the ones who struggled and sacrificed, sometimes gave their lives, to make this country a more equal one. When, it's like those people don't make history, it's us.\n26766\n0\n26767\n0\n26768\n0\n26769\n0\n26770\n0\n26771\n0\n26772\n0\n26773\n0\n26774\n0\n26775\n0\n26776\n0\n26777\nWhen I was writing 'The Abstinence Teacher,' I really tried to immerse myself in contemporary American evangelical culture.\n26778\nI imagine a school system that recognizes learning is natural, that a love of learning is normal, and that real learning is passionate learning. A school curriculum that values questions above answers...creativity above fact regurgitation...individuality above conformity.. and excellence above standardized performance..... And we must reject all notions of 'reform' that serve up more of the same: more testing, more 'standards', more uniformity, more conformity, more bureaucracy.\n26779\n0\n26780\nI don't understand the ones that have no sense of hope and invest in hate.

I wish I could tell you that you’ll always be on top of the mountain, but the reality is that there are days when nothing will go right, when not only will you not be on top, you may not even be able to figure out which way is up. Do yourself a favor, and don’t make it any harder than it has to be. In those moments,      be careful how you speak to yourself;      be careful how you think of yourself;      be careful how you conduct yourself;      be careful how you develop yourself.\n26921\n0\n26922\n0\n26923\n0\n26924\n0\n26925\n0\n26926\nYou change or you hide your head in the sand.\n26927\nI think the problem with polemics is that it's general and it's lazy. When you say, \"This is bad,\" that's a general thing.

I realized that building stuff and being creative and inventive made me happy. Connecting with a friend and talking through the entire night until the sun rose made me happy. Trick-or-treating in middle school with a group of my closest friends made me happy. Eating a baked potato after a swim meet made me happy.

One, in terms of role choice and movie choice, I like to do lots of different things, and I think that's the whole fun of it. But I also see it as a buffet in terms of the character.\n26986\n0\n26987\n0\n26988\nI really respect anybody who stands by their truth.\n26989\n0\n26990\n0\n26991\nMy kids will grow up in a house knowing that it's perfectly normal for two men to be in love, it's perfectly normal for two women to be in love. My kids will grow up knowing it's all about love. It doesn't matter who you're with and everyone should have that experience.\n26992\nFor me, as a Christian I will be uncomfortable because in all my teachings and all my learning, biblically, it's not right.\n26993\n0\n26994\n0\n26995\n0\n26996\n0\n26997\n0\n26998\n0\n26999\n0\n27000\n0\n27001\nI love exploring New York and I think that's what is so exciting about it.

I sledded back to a secret zone way deep in the Jackson backcountry to some freeriding. I got out there and followed some snowmobile tracks figuring it's just some snowmobilers.\n27059\n0\n27060\n0\n27061\n0\n27062\n0\n27063\n0\n27064\n0\n27065\n0\n27066\n0\n27067\nI don't agree with the libertarians.

Some people won't like me for it. Some people will. I will work every day to be as honest as I can because I do believe that we're all trying to get to the same place. But various people have tricked us into believing that we are not. And I see America going into that space.\n27089\n0\n27090\n0\n27091\n0\n27092\n0\n27093\n0\n27094\n0\n27095\nAny job is a job.

I haven't insulted you yet, have I?\n27151\n0\n27152\n0\n27153\n0\n27154\nIf we're not reaching the same people Jesus reached, then we're not preaching the same message Jesus preached.\n27155\n0\n27156\n0\n27157\n0\n27158\n0\n27159\n0\n27160\n0\n27161\nWhen you don't have crazy ambitions, you're always happy just kind of getting by. Our expectations were always kept low.

It's always been something I'm very in tune with.\n27174\n0\n27175\n0\n27176\nOur time and attention is scarce. Art is not that important to us, no matter what we might like to believe... Our love of art is often quite temporary, dependent upon our moods, and our love of art is subservient to our demand for a positive self image. How we look at art should account for those imperfections and work around them. Keep in mind that books, like art museums, are not always geared to the desires of the reader. Maybe we think we are supposed to like tough books, but are we? Who says? Many writers (and art museums) produce for quite a small subsample of the... public.\n27177\n0\n27178\n0\n27179\n0\n27180\nI will never be as busy as I was in high school and college.\n27181\n0\n27182\n0\n27183\nI'm a casual watcher. I like to stream everything.\n27184\nWhen you haven't forgiven those who've hurt you, you turn back against your future.

When a man cheats, it's not a reflection of what she's not.\n27196\n0\n27197\n0\n27198\n0\n27199\n0\n27200\n0\n27201\n0\n27202\n0\n27203\n0\n27204\n0\n27205\n0\n27206\n0\n27207\n0\n27208\n0\n27209\n0\n27210\n0\n27211\n0\n27212\n0\n27213\n0\n27214\n0\n27215\n0\n27216\n0\n27217\n0\n27218\n0\n27219\n0\n27220\nWhen asked if I consider myself Buddhist, the answer is, Not really. But it's more my religion than any other because I was brought up with it in an intellectual and spiritual environment. I don't practice or preach it, however. But Buddhism has had a major effect on who I am and how I think about the world. What I have learned is that I like all religions, but only parts of them.\n27221\n0\n27222\n0\n27223\n0\n27224\n0\n27225\n0\n27226\n0\n27227\nCritics of the war plans (including myself) have pointed to the disastrous political results that must be expected: Iraq would break into three parts (Kurds in the north, Sunnis in the center, Shi'ites in the south), the Middle East would be exposed to the onslaught of Iranian fanaticism, pro-Western Arab regimes would collapse. Israel would be surrounded by aggressive Islamic fundamentalism, like the Crusader kingdom with the advent of Saladin.\n27228\n0\n27229\n0\n27230\n0\n27231\nThe key thing is confidence, and you get that from the actions that you take. It can be anything from getting chicks, being in a fight, having success at work, having a good family.

It was a bill of rights for persons with disabilities, a formal acknowledgement that Americans with disabilities are Americans first and that they're entitled to the same rights and freedoms as everybody else.\n27279\nI can't believe the ignorance there, so I don't allow it to affect my life, I don't allow it to come into my zone, and it's not in my world, really.\n27280\n0\n27281\n0\n27282\n0\n27283\n0\n27284\n0\n27285\n0\n27286\n0\n27287\n0\n27288\n0\n27289\n0\n27290\n0\n27291\n0\n27292\n0\n27293\n0\n27294\n0\n27295\nDeep patriots don't just sing the song, 'America the Beautiful' and then go home. We actually stick around to defend America’s beauty -- from the oil spillers, the clear-cutters and the mountaintop removers. Deep patriots don't just visit the Statue of Liberty and send a postcard home to grandma. We defend the principles upon which that great monument was founded -- 'give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.'\n27296\nThe blues - there's no black and white - it's the truth.\n27297\n0\n27298\n0\n27299\nThe environmental movement can only survive if it becomes a justice movement.

And, after all, the director wants the actors to be bringing forth the best that they can, according to whatever vision he has.\n27318\n0\n27319\n0\n27320\n0\n27321\nMy breakdancing crew used to go to the mall and squat a piece of cardboard there; we had our jam box, and I'd spin on my head and make about forty bucks a day, which was pretty good back then. I was only 14 years old, so I would chase the girls around the mall and eat some pizza and have some change left over.\n27322\n0\n27323\n0\n27324\n0\n27325\nI like Iron Maiden and a few other bands, but by and large I don't like metal music.

You have to say, 'That can happen to me.' So always be aware that things can happen.\n27345\nChekhov, when it's done well and you're ready for it, can actually be quite funny.\n27346\n0\n27347\n0\n27348\n0\n27349\nSometimes, reaching out and taking someone's hand is the beginning of a journey. At other times, it is allowing another to take yours.\n27350\nAlthough in skating you compete with other people, anyone who achieves a certain level of success is first and foremost competing against themselves. And for me the idea that I could always do better, learn more, learn faster, is something that came from skating. But I carried that with me for the rest of my life.\n27351\n0\n27352\n0\n27353\n0\n27354\n0\n27355\n0\n27356\n0\n27357\n0\n27358\n0\n27359\n0\n27360\n0\n27361\n0\n27362\n0\n27363\nI wonder if fears ever really go away, or if they just lose their power over us.\n27364\n0\n27365\n0\n27366\n0\n27367\n0\n27368\n0\n27369\n0\n27370\n0\n27371\n0\n27372\n0\n27373\n0\n27374\n0\n27375\n0\n27376\n0\n27377\nNo doubt I enjoy being close to people in the way I dress, the way I speak, and the way I communicate with people.\n27378\n0\n27379\n0\n27380\n0\n27381\n0\n27382\n0\n27383\n0\n27384\n0\n27385\n0\n27386\n0\n27387\nIt's amazing, especially coming from the small city of Paterson, to have all of those people just being behind you and supporting your career and understanding where you come from.\n27388\nAfter three elections, voters finally caught on that Obama's faults were not in the stars, but in himself.

I don't personally know some of the Disney girls as well as I know some of the Nickelodeon girls, but I have run into them and talked to them and they're all really cool and I respect them and what they do and I'm just trying to do my own thing.\n27416\nI wouldn't mind doing a soundtrack someday.\n27417\nIt's very easy for me to just encourage people in their family life and in their children. It's just very natural to me.

That's not what music is to me. You can explain aspects of it in physical terms, including the physics of anatomy: how our bodies move, the torsional moment of inertia, the way you move your body to a beat, the inherent periodicities of the heartbeat, the gait. That's physics, too, I guess - maybe they'd call it biophysics.\n27434\n0\n27435\n0\n27436\n0\n27437\n0\n27438\nI'm a student of media and I've always been one.

The guys and the game, and I love the challenge of describing things.

And there's something to be said for that. Because you don't want to - I think most political poetry is very bad. And it's very bad because you know too much to start with. You have a sense that you're right, and you're trying to tell other people what's right.

This is mainly because many labels are afraid to take big risks on something that sounds too different than the status quo.\n27765\n0\n27766\n0\n27767\n0\n27768\nNobody's ever asked me to pay for a meal before I've eaten it, I've never been pulled over just because I was driving the wrong kind of car in the wrong kind of area at the wrong time of night.\n27769\n0\n27770\n0\n27771\nNever wallow in your troubles; despair must be kept private and brief.\n27772\n0\n27773\n0\n27774\n0\n27775\nWhen I see the first dailies on any movie, I usually feel that I had no idea how this combination of ingredients was going to mix together, what it was going to produce.\n27776\n0\n27777\n0\n27778\n0\n27779\n0\n27780\n0\n27781\n0\n27782\n0\n27783\n0\n27784\n0\n27785\nThe campaign in Iraq illustrates the continuing progress of military technology and tactics, but if there is a single overriding lesson it must be this: American military power, especially when buttressed by Britain's, is virtually unchallengeable today. Take us on? Don't try! And that's not hubris, it's just plain fact.\n27786\n0\n27787\n0\n27788\n0\n27789\nI mainly buy books in my free time.\n27790\n0\n27791\n0\n27792\n0\n27793\n0\n27794\nI can talk about Jane Austen until the cows come home.\n27795\n0\n27796\n0\n27797\n0\n27798\n0\n27799\n0\n27800\n0\n27801\n0\n27802\n0\n27803\nIf you get a little gassy, you've got to let it go.

And I'd think, well, what is it that I've never been able to do that this person or people are able to do with this song? Why haven't I been able to do it, and what can they do that I wish I could do? And then I'd try to do that. I'd start each day getting into the songs, and I'd think about how I might get closer to this music that I love, but haven't been able to make before.\n27847\n0\n27848\n0\n27849\n0\n27850\n0\n27851\nI think I now understand why it is that the young are so very nostalgic. They have so little by way of personal history that they polish it up and make it shine like a treasured heirloom.\n27852\nCulture dictated from above is the enemy of folk music. Whether it's stuffy classical music or pre-engineered pop where somebody's paid tons of money to make sure that everyone hears this song a certain number of times a day - that feels like the opposite of folk music.\n27853\n0\n27854\n0\n27855\nI'm motivated by fear. Fear of fear. I hate being scared to do something.

Whereas easy appeals to mystery prematurely shut off reflection about God, rigorous and earnest effort to understand him is richly rewarded with deeper appreciation of who he is, more confidence in his reality and care, and a more intelligent and profound worship of his person.\n27956\n0\n27957\n0\n27958\n0\n27959\n0\n27960\n0\n27961\n0\n27962\n0\n27963\n0\n27964\n0\n27965\n0\n27966\nI write, and when see a movie in which it's supernatural, some other worlds, or some other aspect to our world that we're not aware of, and [they] don't explain what the rules are, that kind of stuff drives me crazy.\n27967\nI think as designers we realize design is a signal of intention, but it also has to occur within a world and we have to understand that world in order to imbue our designs with inherent intelligence.\n27968\n0\n27969\n0\n27970\n0\n27971\nLondon matters to me because it's the center of what I do for a living and has been since Tudor times.\n27972\n0\n27973\n0\n27974\n0\n27975\n0\n27976\n0\n27977\n0\n27978\n0\n27979\n0\n27980\nI want to live and work in Chicago for the rest of my life.

To me, that city is like one big stage for Edward Hopper. You could put your camera anywhere, and you felt you were looking at his paintings.\n28045\nThere's the idea that you have to know how to solve the world's problems in order to feel that something is morally wrong.

If we want to prevent attacks, we'll need more information and better integration.\n28077\n0\n28078\nSometimes it takes a long time for a picture to incubate. And every time I do that, the rewards are so much bigger than what I would have gotten if I had only done the same as I always do. So each time I make an effort and I get out of a lazy routine, it's amazing how big the reward can be. It's listening to those little ideas knocking on the door in your mind.\n28079\n0\n28080\n0\n28081\n0\n28082\nIf you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans.\n28083\nIve always believed the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.\n28084\n0\n28085\n0\n28086\n0\n28087\n0\n28088\n0\n28089\n0\n28090\n0\n28091\n0\n28092\n0\n28093\n0\n28094\nI'm 27 years old.

It's going to be hot.\n28095\n0\n28096\nYou can reach a situation where things of intelligence and refinement and culture can be considered elite, and things that are crass and ignorant can be considered to be real and of the people. And when you begin to have the mass of populus striving for something that's not worth striving for, then tremendous amounts of energy go into...the maintenance of that which is worthless.\n28097\n0\n28098\n0\n28099\n0\n28100\n0\n28101\n0\n28102\n0\n28103\n0\n28104\n0\n28105\n0\n28106\n0\n28107\n0\n28108\n0\n28109\n0\n28110\n0\n28111\n0\n28112\n0\n28113\n0\n28114\n0\n28115\n0\n28116\n0\n28117\n0\n28118\n0\n28119\n0\n28120\n0\n28121\n0\n28122\n0\n28123\n0\n28124\n0\n28125\n0\n28126\n0\n28127\n0\n28128\n0\n28129\n0\n28130\n0\n28131\n0\n28132\n0\n28133\n0\n28134\n0\n28135\n0\n28136\n0\n28137\n0\n28138\n0\n28139\n0\n28140\nThere are always those who take it upon themselves to defend God... These people fail to realize that it is on the inside that God must be defended, not on the outside.\n28141\n0\n28142\nI learned from my parents to do my best to not react to negative emotions. I try to think about what has happened and find the lessons that can be learned from these difficult experiences. I try to deal with these negative emotions right away because, if they stay inside, they can hurt and do a lot of damage. I release them as soon as possible so I can be free.\n28143\n0\n28144\n0\n28145\n0\n28146\n0\n28147\n0\n28148\n0\n28149\n0\n28150\n0\n28151\n0\n28152\n0\n28153\n0\n28154\n0\n28155\n0\n28156\nWhen I was 12 or 13, I started to watch films and understand more about the craft and that helped me to develop. But it also felt like a game, because it was fun. I mean, all of us do it when we're kids to a degree - play acting. But then I came to realise that it's a lovely way to express yourself. So, my passion for it developed as I got older.\n28157\n0\n28158\n0\n28159\n0\n28160\n0\n28161\n0\n28162\n0\n28163\n0\n28164\n0\n28165\n0\n28166\n0\n28167\nI read the art reviews of my work.

First, you must realize that not all women are beautiful all of the time. Sometimes beauty comes on a subconscious level. When she is in love, or has met someone new and exciting, she shines. Second, you must understand that life is unfair. Beauty is something that, for some, must be worked at. The third condition is luck. Some women can just be lucky.\n28192\n0\n28193\nI really feel that artists or musicians are controversial people. Controversy is part of the nature of art and creativity.

Sometimes you might here different things; it depends on how you feel. You might feel down, and I might be the cat in the same sentence saying, \"You need to get up and do your thing.\" And then I could be the same cat, when you at the top of your game, telling you, \"It feel good, don't it?\" but with the same words.\n28221\n0\n28222\nThis is the industry that wants [music], the rap industry.\n28223\n0\n28224\n0\n28225\n0\n28226\n0\n28227\n0\n28228\n0\n28229\nOur population is growing rapidly because of our good health policy. When I came into office, there were 14 million Ugandans, today there are 38 million, despite the catastrophe of AIDS, which we have also tackled.

If I could choose to never travel again but still do all my shows - I mean, who wouldn't want to do that? That's the work aspect of it. Maybe people don't think about it this way, but it makes it feel like a job when you're playing late and getting up really early for a lobby call, and flying around.\n28240\n0\n28241\n0\n28242\n0\n28243\n0\n28244\n0\n28245\n0\n28246\n0\n28247\n0\n28248\n0\n28249\n0\n28250\n0\n28251\nEach member were lead singers from different groups but later we were put together to make DBSK.\n28252\n0\n28253\n0\n28254\n0\n28255\n0\n28256\n0\n28257\n0\n28258\n0\n28259\n0\n28260\n0\n28261\n0\n28262\n0\n28263\n0\n28264\n0\n28265\n0\n28266\n0\n28267\n0\n28268\n0\n28269\n0\n28270\n0\n28271\nThe solution may be for a lot of the world's problems is to turn around and take a forward step.

I'm a bit of an artist.\n28278\n0\n28279\n0\n28280\nThe media is constantly redefining what luxury is. Luxury can be a dirty sock if dressed up in the right way.\n28281\n0\n28282\nEven if you have an ADA room, every disability is so different that people need different things. A lot of times they'll put something on the toilet to make it higher, and for someone transferring from their chair that's fine, but I transfer from the floor so it causes more problems.\n28283\nYea, I had a dream too. Looks like mine came true.\n28284\nI tried to go to community college for a while, and it's a funny story. I walked into the English class on the first day, and they told us to write about what we did over the summer. I can't remember exactly, but I think I walked out exactly at that point and went to the office to ask for my money back.\n28285\nYou write things that are of interest to you. There's no focus group.\n28286\n0\n28287\n0\n28288\n0\n28289\n0\n28290\n0\n28291\n0\n28292\n0\n28293\n0\n28294\nA record is worth 10,000 live shows.\n28295\n0\n28296\nI don't believe in strong-arming people.\n28297\nMy dad died when I was a kid, so I think it became a place for me to go where my mom knew that I was safe and taken care of and looked after.\n28298\n0\n28299\n0\n28300\n0\n28301\n0\n28302\n0\n28303\nI imagine the film [\"300\"] as if I was a Spartan and I had never seen an immortal or a Persian, or an elephant or a rhino for that matter.\n28304\n0\n28305\nPeople don't settle for people. They resolve to be with them. It takes faith. You draw a circle in the sand and agree to stand in it and believe in it.\n28306\n0\n28307\n0\n28308\nDo you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life?\n28309\n0\n28310\n0\n28311\n0\n28312\n0\n28313\n0\n28314\n0\n28315\nIt's just a natural progression. You're a player, then you're a coach, then you're general manager for the team, and then the next logical step for me and you would be [to become] team owner.\n28316\n0\n28317\n0\n28318\n0\n28319\n0\n28320\n0\n28321\n0\n28322\n0\n28323\n0\n28324\nI think it is essential that America does not stumble into a stupid war with Iran.\n28325\n0\n28326\n0\n28327\n0\n28328\n0\n28329\n0\n28330\n0\n28331\n0\n28332\n0\n28333\n0\n28334\nThe secret to a really great friendship is just creating fun memories whenever you're with that person.\n28335\n0\n28336\nYou can have very big local government. By big, I mean very engaged government. Do you measure it in terms of the number of laws? Number of employees? You could make arguments for either one. I tend to think the axis of the size of government is the wrong concern. But I do think that situating power more locally is a legitimate approach.\n28337\n0\n28338\n0\n28339\n0\n28340\nOn the one hand the world is getting more integrated and we should not dismiss social values as \"Western\" when they are actually modern values. On the other hand, individual countries have their own history and their own evolution. Trade unions, for example, don't play the same role in China as they do in Europe or the US.\n28341\n0\n28342\n0\n28343\n0\n28344\n0\n28345\n0\n28346\n0\n28347\n0\n28348\n0\n28349\nIt don't last forever, the pain. Realize that tomorrow is coming. Move further from this pain and this stress.\n28350\n0\n28351\n0\n28352\nI can play in the 11 positions because a good player can play anywhere on the pitch.\n28353\nI love the idea of doing comedy, whether it's action comedy or just straight comedy. It's such a big, new world for me that I'm starting to realize that any character that I relate to, in any way, shape or form, or that I have any appreciation for, given enough preparation, I can find that person.\n28354\n0\n28355\n0\n28356\n0\n28357\nI find playwriting to be incredibly difficult compared to screenwriting. Part of it is that I grew up watching movies and not watching plays.\n28358\n0\n28359\nI'm pretty much a thrift shop gal. Flea markets on Sundays.\n28360\nI'm a health-food junkie, so all of my food is a splurge, money-wise!\n28361\n0\n28362\n0\n28363\nI don't understand labels. I don't need anybody to tell me I'm Latina or black or anything else. I've played characters that were written for Caucasian females, I just want to be given the same consideration as everybody else, and so far that has been happening.\n28364\n0\n28365\n0\n28366\n0\n28367\n0\n28368\n0\n28369\n0\n28370\nI'm such a fan of Shailene Woodley, so I'm super excited to see all her stuff. She's an awesome actress.\n28371\n0\n28372\nI think I'm making music that's pretty universal.\n28373\nI think my knowledge of music theory is rooted in jazz theory, and a lot of the writers of standards - Rodgers and Hart, and Gershwin.\n28374\n0\n28375\n0\n28376\n0\n28377\n0\n28378\n0\n28379\n0\n28380\n0\n28381\n0\n28382\n0\n28383\n0\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n# Tạo DataFrame từ danh sách này\nconcat_df = pd.DataFrame({'25th': lens})\n\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-06T08:44:18.701430Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-06T08:44:18.702108Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-06T08:44:18.708769Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-06T08:44:18.702077Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-06T08:44:18.707917Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":97,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"concat_df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-06T08:44:24.058848Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-06T08:44:24.059544Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-06T08:44:24.069819Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-06T08:44:24.059512Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-06T08:44:24.068773Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":98,"outputs":[{"execution_count":98,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"                                                    25th\n0                                                      0\n1      Traditionally, with a DJ set, you just go hear...\n2                                                      0\n3                                                      0\n4                                                      0\n...                                                  ...\n28379                                                  0\n28380                                                  0\n28381                                                  0\n28382                                                  0\n28383                                                  0\n\n[28384 rows x 1 columns]","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>25th</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Traditionally, with a DJ set, you just go hear...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>28379</th>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>28380</th>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>28381</th>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>28382</th>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>28383</th>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>28384 rows × 1 columns</p>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"final_result = pd.concat([result, concat_df], axis=1)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-06T08:45:17.745986Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-06T08:45:17.746614Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-06T08:45:17.765813Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-06T08:45:17.746580Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-06T08:45:17.765052Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":99,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"final_result","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-06T08:45:23.510282Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-06T08:45:23.511339Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-06T08:45:23.530346Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-06T08:45:23.511307Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-06T08:45:23.529362Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":100,"outputs":[{"execution_count":100,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"       index         Column1                   Column2               Column3  \\\n0          2   A Fine Frenzy         Singer-songwriter  b.
